    1. The programmer should not now select which 'Form' to display himself.  Instead, he should set the NEXT_ACTIVE_FORM class variable.  
       See the registerForm method for details.
       
       Doing this will avoid accidentally exceeding the maximum recursion depth.  Forms themselves should be placed under the management
       of the class using the 'addForm' or 'addFormClass' method.
       
       NB.  * Applications should therefore use this mechanism in preference to calling the .edit() method of any form. *
       
    2. Forms that are managed by this class can access a proxy to the parent application through their ".parentApp" attribute, which is
       created by this class.
       
    3. a Optionally, Forms managed by this class may be given an .activate method, which will be called instead of their .edit loop
       
       b If not given an .activate method, any .afterEditing method which a form possesses will be called after .edit() has exited.  
         3b is the preferred method to change NEXT_ACTIVE_FORM
         
    4. The method onInMainLoop is called after each screen has exited. This can be overridden. 
    
    5. This method should be able to see which screen was last active using the self._LAST_NEXT_ACTIVE_FORM attribute, which is only set
       just before each screen is displayed.
       
    6. Unless you override the attribute STARTING_FORM, the first form to be called should be named 'MAIN'
    
    7. Do override the onStart and onCleanExit functions if you wish.
    
    
        This function starts the application. It is usually called indirectly through the function .run().  
        You should not override this function, but override the onInMainLoop, onStart and
        onCleanExit methods instead, if you need to modify the application's behaviour. 

        When this method is called, it will activate the form named by the class variable STARTING_FORM.  By default this Form will be called
        'MAIN'.  

        When that form exits (user selecting an ok button or the like), the form named by object variable NEXT_ACTIVE_FORM will be activated.

        If NEXT_ACTIVE_FORM is None, the main() loop will exit.
        
        The form selected will be edited using it's .edit() method UNLESS it has been provided with an .activate() method,
        in which case that method will be called instead.  This is done so that the same class of form can be made 
        NPSAppManaged aware and have the normal non-NPSAppManaged edit loop.
        
        After a Form has been edited, if it has an .afterEditing method, this will be called, unless it was invoked with the activate() method.
        A similar .beforeEditing method will be called if it exists before editing the form.  Again, the presence of a .activate method
        will override this behaviour.
        
        Note that NEXT_ACTIVE_FORM is a string that is the name of the form that was specified when .addForm or .registerForm was called.

        That means a user of a reference to it, can use it for dicts and set

        At this point, options will be parsed already, Nuitka will be executing
        in the desired version of Python with desired flags, and we just get
        to execute the task assigned.

        We might be asked to only re-compile generated C, dump only an XML
        representation of the internal node tree after optimization, etc.

            modules    - all the modules to build.

        Returns:
            Dictionary mapping modules to filenames in source_dir.

        Notes:
            These filenames can collide, due to e.g. mixed case usage, or there
            being duplicate copies, e.g. a package named the same as the main
            binary.

            Conflicts are resolved by appending @<number> with a count in the
            list of sorted modules. We try to be reproducible here, so we get
            still good caching for external tools.
     This is the main actions of Nuitka.

This can do all the steps to translate one module to a target language using
the Python C/API, to compile it to either an executable or an extension
module, potentially with bytecode included and used library copied into
a distribution folder.

Total memory usage before generating C code: {memory}:plugins_dir__import__('%s')

Nuitka is very syntax compatible with standard Python. It is currently running
with Python version '%s', you might want to specify more clearly with the use
of the precise Python interpreter binary and '-m nuitka', e.g. use this
'python%s -m nuitka' option, if that's not the one the program expects.
Not recursing to unused '%s'.cache_modecleanSourceDirectory.<locals>.checkstandalone_mode__helpers.h Create a node tree.

    Turn that source code into a node tree structure. If recursion into
    imported modules is available, more trees will be available during
    optimization, or immediately through recursed directory paths.

    There is a set of root modules, which are user specified, and must be

other allowed value is 'pefile'.Include a whole package. Give as a Python namespace, e.g. ``some_package.sub_package``

Defaults to off.Python flags to use. Default uses what you are using to run Nuitka, this
enforces a specific mode. These are options that also exist to standard
Python executable. Currently supported: "-S" (alias "nosite"),
"static_hashes" (not use hash randomization), "no_warnings" (do not give
Python runtime warnings), "-O" (alias "noasserts"). Default empty.Create an extension module executable instead of a program. Defaults to off.--disable-pluginThe file name of user plugin. Can be given multiple times. Default empty.Enforce the use of specific MSVC version on Windows. Allowed values
are e.g. 14.0, specify an illegal value for a list of installed compilers.

Defaults to the most recent version.Include into files matching the PATTERN. Overrides all recursion other options.
Can be given multiple times. Default empty.Provide progress information and statistics.

features are present in the code. Uses secret tags (check source) per
experimented feature.If using Python3.3 or Python3.4, provide the path of a Python binary to use

full list and exit. Default empty.--profile--python-for-scons--warn-unusual-codeInclude a single module. Give as a Python namespace, e.g. ``some_package.some_module``
and Nuitka will then find it and include it in the binary or extension module
it creates, and make it available for import by the code. Default empty.Traced execution output, output the line of code before executing it.
Defaults to off.--follow-stdlib--gdbInclude the content of that directory, no matter if it's used by the given main
program in a visible form. Overrides all other recursion options. Can be given
multiple times. Default empty.Take existing files and compile them again. Allows compiling edited C files
with the C compiler for quick debugging changes to the generated source.
Defaults to off. Depends on compiling Python source to determine which files it
should look at.Execute inside "gdb" to automatically get a stack trace.
Defaults to off.Provide a final summary on included modules.
Defaults to off.usage: %prog [options] main_module.pyKeep debug info in the resulting object file for better debugger interaction.
Defaults to off.Enforce the use of MinGW64 on Windows.
Defaults to off.Enforce the use of clang. On Windows this requires a working Visual
Studio version to piggy back.
Defaults to off.Plugins can detect if they might be used, and the you can disable the warning
via --plugin-disable=plugin-that-warned, or you can use this option to disable
the mechanism entirely, which also speeds up compilation slightly of course as
this detection code is run in vain once you are certain of which plug-ins to
use.

Default uses what you are using to run Nuitka, most
likely a non-debug version.--include-plugin-files--recurse-toGenerate only C source code, and do not compile it to binary or module. This
is for debugging and code coverage analysis that doesn't waste CPU. Defaults to
off.Add executable icon (Windows only).Specify how the executable should be named. For extension modules there is no
choice, also not for standalone mode and using it will be an error. This may
include path information that needs to exist though. Defaults to <program_name> on this
platform.

Defaults to %s.Windows specific controlsEnable warnings for unusual code detected at compile time.Executable: Output details of actions taken, esp. in optimizations. Can become a lot.
Defaults to off.Enforce absolute compatibility with CPython. Do not even allow minor
deviations from CPython behavior, e.g. better tracebacks, which are
not really incompatible, but different. This is intended for tests
only and should not be necessary for normal use.--recurse-stdlib--plugin-enableDo not create a ".pyi" file for extension modules created by Nuitka. This is
used to detect implicit imports.
Defaults to off.Disable the dependency walker cache. Will result in much longer times to create
the distribution folder, but might be used in case the cache is suspect to cause
errors.
--include-package--enable-plugin--explain-imports--experimental--trace-executionWhen immediately executing the created binary (--execute), don't reset
PYTHONPATH. When all modules are successfully included, you ought to not need
PYTHONPATH anymore.Control the recursion into imported modulesBackend C compiler choice--user-plugin--unstripped Command line options of Nuitka.

These provide only the optparse options to use, and the mechanic to actually
do it, but updating and checking module "nuitka.Options" values is not in
the scope, to make sure it can be used without.

Note: This is using "optparse", because "argparse" is only Python 2.7 and
higher, and we still support Python 2.6 due to the RHELs still being used,
and despite the long deprecation, it's in every later release.
Disabled plugins. Must be plug-in names. Use --plugin-list to query the
full list and exit. Default empty.Operate Scons in non-quiet mode, showing the executed commands.
Defaults to off.Select what value "__file__" is going to be. With "runtime" (default for
standalone binary mode and module mode), the created binaries and modules,
use the location of themselves to deduct the value of "__file__". Included
packages pretend to be in directories below that location. This allows you
to include data files in deployments. If you merely seek acceleration, it's
better for you to use the "original" value, where the source files location
will be used. With "frozen" a notation "<frozen module_name>" is used. For
compatibility reasons, the "__file__" value will always have ".py" suffix
independent of what it really is.Output choices--file-reference-choiceSpecify the allowed number of parallel C compiler jobs. Defaults to the
system CPU count.
Error, need positional argument with python module or main program.Python: Allow Nuitka to download code if necessary, e.g. dependency walker on Windows.When --recurse-all is used, attempt to descend into all imported modules.
Defaults to off.OS: Dump options for internal tree

This is the main program of Nuitka, it checks the options and then translates
one or more modules to a C source code using Python C/API in a "*.build"
directory and then compiles that to either an executable or an extension module
or package, that can contain all used modules too.
NUITKA_BINARY_NAME/Users/francois.nouaille/dev/osc-cli-curses/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/nuitka/__past__.py
Module like __future__ for things that are changed between Python2 and Python3.

These are here to provide compatible fall-backs. This is required to run the
same code easily with both CPython2 and CPython3. Sometimes, we do not care
about the actual types, or API, but would rather just check for something to
be a "in (str, unicode)" rather than making useless version checks.

<module site-packages.nuitka.__past__>%sMetaClassBasetotal_ordering.<locals>.<lambda>getMetaClassBase.<locals>.MetaClassmeta_class_prefix For Python2/3 compatible source, we create a base class that has the metaclass
    used and doesn't require making a choice.

to build the C files to binary.

You may provide it using option "--python-for-scons=path_to_python.exe"
in case it is not visible in registry, e.g. due to using uninstalled
AnaConda Python.
scons_command Return path to inline copy of scons.  Find a way to call any Python2.

    We also need to preserve PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME, but remove it potentially

        pefile, Portable Executable reader module

All the PE file basic structures are available with their default names as
attributes of the instance returned.

Processed elements such as the import table are made available with lowercase
names, to differentiate them from the upper case basic structure names.

pefile has been tested against many edge cases such as corrupted and malformed
PEs as well as malware, which often attempts to abuse the format way beyond its
standard use. To the best of my knowledge most of the abuse is handled
gracefully.

    This class provides access to most of the information in a PE file.

    It expects to be supplied the name of the file to load or PE data
    to process and an optional argument 'fast_load' (False by default)
    which controls whether to load all the directories information,
    which can be quite time consuming.

    pe = pefile.PE('module.dll')
    pe = pefile.PE(name='module.dll')

    would load 'module.dll' and process it. If the data is already
    available in a buffer the same can be achieved with:

    pe = pefile.PE(data=module_dll_data)

    The "fast_load" can be set to a default by setting its value in the
    module itself by means, for instance, of a "pefile.fast_load = True".
    That will make all the subsequent instances not to load the
    whole PE structure. The "full_load" method can be used to parse
    the missing data at a later stage.

    Basic headers information will be available in the attributes:

    DOS_HEADER
    NT_HEADERS
    FILE_HEADER
    OPTIONAL_HEADER

    All of them will contain among their attributes the members of the
    corresponding structures as defined in WINNT.H

    The raw data corresponding to the header (from the beginning of the
    file up to the start of the first section) will be available in the
    instance's attribute 'header' as a string.

    The sections will be available as a list in the 'sections' attribute.
    Each entry will contain as attributes all the structure's members.

    Directory entries will be available as attributes (if they exist):
    (no other entries are processed at this point)

    DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT (list of ImportDescData instances)
    DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT (ExportDirData instance)
    DIRECTORY_ENTRY_RESOURCE (ResourceDirData instance)
    DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DEBUG (list of DebugData instances)
    DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC (list of BaseRelocationData instances)
    DIRECTORY_ENTRY_TLS
    DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BOUND_IMPORT (list of BoundImportData instances)

    The following dictionary attributes provide ways of mapping different
    constants. They will accept the numeric value and return the string
    representation and the opposite, feed in the string and get the
    numeric constant:

        Parse and process the PE file's data directories.

        If the optional argument 'directories' is given, only
        the directories at the specified indexes will be parsed.
        Such functionality allows parsing of areas of interest
        without the burden of having to parse all others.
        The directories can then be specified as:

        For export / import only:

          directories = [ 0, 1 ]

        or (more verbosely):

          directories = [ DIRECTORY_ENTRY['IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT'],
            DIRECTORY_ENTRY['IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT'] ]

        If 'directories' is a list, the ones that are processed will be removed,
        leaving only the ones that are not present in the image.

        If `forwarded_exports_only` is True, the IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT
        attribute will only contain exports that are forwarded to another DLL.

        If `import_dllnames_only` is True, symbols will not be parsed from
        the import table and the entries in the IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT
        attribute will not have a `symbols` attribute.

    Invalid relocation information. SizeOfBlock too large: %dDump.add_newlineReturns the data corresponding to the memory layout of the PE file.

        The data includes the PE header and the sections loaded at offsets
        corresponding to their relative virtual addresses. (the VirtualAddress
        section header member).
        Any offset in this data corresponds to the absolute memory address
        ImageBase+offset.

        The optional argument 'max_virtual_address' provides with means of limiting
        which sections are processed.
        Any section with their VirtualAddress beyond this value will be skipped.
        Normally, sections with values beyond this range are just there to confuse
        tools. It's a common trick to see in packed executables.

        If the 'ImageBase' optional argument is supplied, the file's relocations
        will be applied to the image by calling the 'relocate_image()' method. Beware
        that the relocation information is applied permanently.

        This function will process all headers and components

        assigning to attributes in the PE objects) and write
        the changes back to a file whose name is provided as
        an argument. The filename is optional, if not
        provided the data will be returned as a 'str' object.

Most the class specific stuff is solved in re-formulation. Only the selection
of the metaclass remains as specific.
 The code generation.

No language specifics at all are supposed to be present here. Instead it is
using primitives from the given generator to build code sequences (list of
strings).

As such this is the place that knows how to take a condition and two code
branches and make a code block out of it. But it doesn't contain any target
language syntax.

This deals with constants, there creation, there access, and some checks about
them. Even mutable constants should not change during the course of the
program.

There are shared constants, which are created for multiple modules to use, you
can think of them as globals. And there are module local constants, which are
for a single module only.

        they are constants, but the "marshal" module refuses to work with
        them.
    nuitka_version_levelMissing optimization for constant to C bool. Emit code for a specific constant to be prepared during init.

        This may be module or global init. Code makes sure that nested
        constants belong into the same scope.

%s = PyNumber_InPlaceSubtract(%s, PyLong_FromLong(1));%s = UNSTREAM_FLOAT(%s);%s = Py_False;constant_counts Try and marshal a value, if so decided. Indicate with return value.

        See above for why marshal is only used in problematic cases.

        This needs to create code to make all global constants (used in more
        than one module) and create them.

    %s = UNSTREAM_STRING_ASCII(%s, %d); Decide if we want to use marshal to create a constant.

        The reason we do this, is because creating dictionaries with 700
        elements creates a lot of C code, while gaining usually no performance
        at all. The MSVC compiler is especially notorious about hanging like
        forever with this active, due to its optimizer not scaling.

        Therefore we use a constant "weight" (how expensive it is), and apply
        that to decide.

        If marshal is not possible, or constant "weight" is too large, we
        don't do it. Also, for some constants, marshal can fail, and return
        other values. Check that too. In that case, we have to create it.

These are the helper functions that will emit the error exit codes. They
can abstractly check conditions or values directly. The release of statement
temporaries from context is automatic.

Also formatting errors is done here, avoiding PyErr_Format as much as
possible.

And releasing of values, as this is what the error case commonly does.

of course types could play into it. Then there is also the added difficulty of

This is broken down to to level on printing one individual item, and
a new line potentially. The heavy lifting for 'softspace', etc. is
happening in the C helper functions.

PRINT_NEW_LINE_TO(%s) == false Code generation for standard CPython/API calls.

This is generic stuff, geared at calling functions that accept Python objects
and return Python objects. As these all work in a similar way, it makes sense
to concentrate the best way to do to make those calls here.

Also, many Nuitka helper codes turn out to be very similar to Python C/API
and then can use the same code.

For Nuitka, all try/except and try/finally are dealt with this, where the
finally block gets duplicated into handlers. So this is a common low level
structure used, where exception handling and everything is made explicit.

This is not about caching the search of modules in the file system, but about
maintaining a cache of module trees built.

It can happen that modules become unused, and then dropped from active modules,
and then later active again, via another import, and in this case, we should
not start anew, but reuse what we already found out about it.

     Locating modules and package source on disk.

The actual import of a module would already execute code that changes
things. Imagine a module that does ``os.system()``, it would be done during
compilation. People often connect to databases, and these kind of things,
at import time.

Therefore CPython exhibits the interfaces in an ``imp`` module in standard
library, which one can use those to know ahead of time, what file import would
load. For us unfortunately there is nothing in CPython that is easily
accessible and gives us this functionality for packages and search paths
exactly like CPython does, so we implement here a multi step search process
that is compatible.

This approach is much safer of course and there is no loss. To determine if
it's from the standard library, one can abuse the attribute ``__file__`` of
the ``os`` module like it's done in ``isStandardLibraryPath`` of this module.

This tries to extract "namespaces" packages that were manually created and
point to package directories, which need no "__init__.py" to count as a
package. Nuitka will pretend for those that there be one, but without content.
Python installation problem, cannot read file '%s'. Extract packages with no __file__, i.e. they got added manually.

        They are frequently created with "*.pth" files that then check for the

        loading of "site.py" an package with "__path__" set.

The most simple assignment statement ``a = b`` is what we have here. All others
are either re-formulated using temporary variables, e.g. ``a, b = c`` or are
attribute, slice, subscript assignments.

The deletion is a separate node unlike in CPython where assigning to ``NULL`` is
internally what deletion is. But deleting is something entirely different to us
during code generation, which is why we keep them separate.

Tracing assignments in SSA form is the core of optimization for which we use
the traces.

     Attribute nodes

Knowing attributes of an object is very important, esp. when it comes to 'self'
and objects and classes.

There will be a methods "computeExpression*Attribute" to aid predicting them,
with many variants for setting, deleting, and accessing. Also there is some
complication in the form of special lookups, that won't go through the normal
path, but just check slots.

Due to ``getattr`` and ``setattr`` built-ins, there is also a different in the
computations for objects and for compile time known strings. This reflects what
CPython also does with "tp_getattr" and "tp_getattro".

These nodes are therefore mostly delegating the work to expressions they
work on, and let them decide and do the heavy lifting of optimization
and annotation is happening in the nodes that implement these compute slots.

These are good for optimizations, as they give a very well known result. In the case of
'chr', it's one of 256 strings, and in case of 'ord' it's one of 256 numbers, so these can
answer quite a few questions at compile time.

ExpressionBuiltinStaticmethod.computeExpression Built-in staticmethod/classmethod nodes

These are good for optimizations, as they give a very well known result, changing
only the way a class member is being called. Being able to avoid going through a
C call to the built-ins resulting wrapper, will speed up things.

This is a specific thing, which must be calculated at run time, but we can
predict things about its type, and the fact that it won't raise an exception
for some types, so it is still useful. Also calls to it can be accelerated
slightly.

These are divided into variants for one and two arguments and they have a
common base class, because most of the behavior is the same there. The ones
with 2 arguments only work on strings, and give errors otherwise, the ones
with one argument, use slots, "__int__" and "__long__", so what they do does
largely depend on the arguments slot.

There will be a method "computeExpressionCall" to aid predicting them in other

Lambdas are functions too. The functions are at the core of the language and
have their complexities.

Creating a CPython function object is an optional thing. Some things might
only be used to be called directly, while knowing exactly what it is. So
the "ExpressionFunctionCreation" might be used to provide that kind of
CPython reference, and may escape.

Coroutines and generators live in their dedicated module and share base
classes.

        Normally it's good to lookup name references immediately, but not for
        functions. In case of a function body it is not allowed to do that,
        because a later assignment needs to be queried first. Nodes need to
        indicate via this if they would like to resolve references at the same
        time as assignments.

        The __spec__ is used by the loader mechanism and sometimes
        by code checking e.g. if something is a package. It exists
        only for modern Python. For the main program module, it's
        always None (it is also not really loaded in the same way
        as other code).

        The __file__ is a static or dynamic value depending on the
        file reference mode. If it requests runtime, i.e. looks at
        where it is loaded from, then there is not a lot to be said
        about its value, otherwise it becomes a constant value
        quickly.

The represent special values of the modules. The __name__,
__package__, __file__, and __spec__ values can all be highly
dynamic and version dependent.

These nodes are intended to allow for as much compile time
optimization as possible, despite this difficulty. In some
modes these node become constants quickly, in others they
will present boundaries for optimization.

These are for use in optimizations and computations, and therefore cover
mostly exceptions and constants.

Often cyclic dependencies kicks in, which is why this module is mostly only
imported locally. Note: It's intended to be reversed, this module will make
the local imports instead, as these local imports look ugly everywhere else,
making it more difficult to use.

        This is for a call to a function to be called in-line to be executed
        in a specific context. It contains an exclusively owned function body,
        that has no other references, and can be considered part of the calling

        As normal function it must return a value, to use as expression value,
        but we know we only exist once.

        Once this has no frame, it can be changed to a mere outline expression.

Subscripts are important when working with lists and dictionaries. Tracking
them can allow to achieve more compact code, or predict results at compile time.

There is be a method "computeExpressionSubscript" to aid predicting them in the
other nodes.

This one just determines types. It's great for optimization. We may be able to
predict its value, but knowing it. In that case, we have a built-in name
reference for that type to convert to, or when checking the result of it, we
will then know it's limited after the fact.

        The special thing about this as opposed to ExpressionVariableNameRef is that

        used for __annotations__.

        or higher.

        Similar to yield from. The actual lookups of awaitable go through
        slots and have dedicated nodes.
    ExpressionYieldBase.isExceptionPreservingExpressionYield.__init__site-packages.nuitka.nodes.YieldNodesExpressionYieldFrom.__init__ Yield node.

The yield node returns to the caller of the generator and therefore may execute
absolutely arbitrary code, from the point of view of this code. It then returns
something, which may often be 'None', but doesn't have to be.

Often it will be used as a statement, which should also be reflected in a
dedicated node.

        Can only happen in a generator. Kind of explicitly suspends and
        resumes the execution. The user may inject any kind of exception
        or give any return value. The value of "None" is the most common
        though, esp. if it's not used.

        Typical code: yield from expression (Python3)

        Can only happen in a generator and only in Python3. Similar to yield,
        but implies a loop and exception propagation to the yield from generator
        if such. Kind of explicitly suspends and resumes the execution. The
        user may inject any kind of exception or give any return value. Having
        a return value is what makes Python3 generators special, and with yield
        from, that value is the expression result.

        Args:

            collection: To pass the collection that will be the parent
        Notes:
            Currently this is unused. Passing "collection" as an argument, so
            we know the original collection to attach the branch to, is maybe
            not the most clever way to do this

            We also might want to specialize functions for specific exceptions,
            there is little point in providing BaseException as an argument in
            so many places.

            The actual storage of the exceptions that can occur is currently
            missing entirely. We just use this to detect "any exception" by
            not being empty.

Value traces indicate the flow of values and merges their versions for
the SSA (Single State Assignment) form being used in Nuitka.

Values can be seen as:

* Unknown (maybe initialized, maybe not, we cannot know)
* Uninit (definitely not initialized, first version, or after "del" statement)
* Init (definitely initialized, e.g. parameter variables)
* Merge (result of diverged code paths, loop potentially)
* LoopInitial (aggregation during loops, not yet fully known)
* LoopComplete (complete knowledge of loop types)
ValueTraceLoopComplete.addNameUsage<module site-packages.nuitka.plugins> Provide additional modules to import implicitly when encountering the module.

        Notes:
            Better do not overload this method.
            The standard plugin 'ImplicitImports.py' already contains MANY of these.

        Notes:
            Setting this to true is only applicable to standard plugins. In
            this case, the plugin will be enabled upon Nuitka start-up. Any
            plugin detector class will then be ignored. Method isRelevant() may
            also be present and can be used to fine-control enabling the

Plugins: Welcome to Nuitka! This is your shortest way to become part of it.

This is to provide the base class for all plug-ins. Some of which are part of
proper Nuitka, and some of which are waiting to be created and submitted for
inclusion by you.

The base class will serve as documentation. And it will point to examples of
it being used.
/Users/francois.nouaille/dev/osc-cli-curses/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/nuitka/plugins/PluginBase.py-postLoadError, conflicting options values given.NuitkaPluginBase.decideRecursion Decide which C defines to be used in compilation.

        Notes:
            The plugins can each contribute, but are hopefully using
            a namespace for their defines.

        Returns:
            None for no defines, otherwise dictionary of key to be
            defined, and non-None values if any, i.e. no "-Dkey" only
        Error, conflicting plug-ins for %sNuitkaPluginBase.suppressBuiltinImportWarning_module_packageNuitkaPluginBase.createPreModuleLoadCode Called after successfully finishing a standalone compile.

        Note:
            It is up to the plugin to take subsequent action. Examples are:
            insert additional information (license, copyright, company or
            application description), create installation material, further
            folder clean-up, start downstream applications etc.

        Args:
            dist_dir: the created distribution folder

        Returns:
            None
         Provide a dictionary of fallback imports for modules that failed to import.

        Args:
            module_name: name of module
        Returns:
            dict
        NuitkaPluginBase.getPluginOptions Provide a filename / -path for a to-be-imported module.

        Args:
            importing: module object
            module_name: (str or ModuleName) full name of module
            warn: (bool) True if required module

        Injecting plug-in based post load code for module '%s':NuitkaPluginBase.considerImplicitImports_module_name2NuitkaPluginBase.getExtraCodeFiles Nuitka base class for all plug-ins.

    Derive your plugin from "UserPlugin" please.

    Plugins allow to adapt Nuitka's behaviour in a number of ways as explained
    below at the individual methods.

    It is used to deal with special requirements some packages may have (e.g. PyQt
    and tkinter), data files to be included (e.g. certifi), inserting hidden
    code, coping with otherwise undetectable needs, or issuing messages in
    certain situations.

    A plugin in general must be enabled to be used by Nuitka. This happens by
    specifying "--enable-plugin" (standard plugins) or by "--user-plugin" (user
    plugins) in the Nuitka command line. However, some plugins are always enabled
    and invisible to the user.

    Nuitka comes with a number of "standard" plugins to be enabled as needed.
    What they are can be displayed using "nuitka --plugin-list file.py" (filename
    required but ignored).

    User plugins may be specified (and implicitly enabled) using their Python
    script pathname.
    NuitkaPluginBase.considerExtraDllsNuitkaPluginBase.onFrozenModuleSourceCode Return all options for the plugin.

        Notes:
            This method will always return a list of strings.
            To specify options, code '=' immediately after the plugin name / script name.
            The following string (excluding next space) will be returned after applying split(",").
            You are free to specify anything. Use quotes to include spaces. See below for examples.

        Returns:
            list of strings

        Examples:
            For a plugin called "name"

    Notes:
        Load user plugins provided as Python script file names, and standard

        The final result is 'active_plugin_list' which contains all enabled
        plugins.
        User plugins are enabled as a first step, because they themselves may
        enable standard plugins.

Plugins: Welcome to Nuitka! This is your shortest way to become part of it.

This is to provide the base class for all plug-ins. Some of which are part of
proper Nuitka, and some of which are waiting to be created and submitted for
inclusion by you.

The base class in PluginBase will serve as documentation of available.

library_name/Users/francois.nouaille/dev/osc-cli-curses/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/nuitka/plugins/Plugins.py Let plugins decide whether to suppress import warnings for builtin modules.

        Notes:
            Return will be True if at least one plugin returns other than False or None,
            else False.

        Notes:
            The plugins can each contribute, but are hopefully using
            a namespace for their defines.

        Returns:
            OrderedDict(), where None value indicates no define value,

Nuitka can detect some things that PyLint and PyDev will complain about too,
and sometimes it's a false alarm, so people add disable markers into their
source code. Nuitka does it itself.

This tries to parse the code for these markers and uses hooks to prevent Nuitka
from warning about things, disabled to PyLint or Eclipse. The idea is that we
won't have another mechanism for Nuitka, but use existing ones instead.

The code for this is very incomplete, barely good enough to cover Nuitka's own
usage of PyLint markers. PyDev is still largely to be started. You are welcome
to grow both.

    Notes:
        This should be required in rare occasions only. The one example I know

        When running in accelerated mode, it's not good to fork a new Python
        instance to run other code, as that won't be accelerated. And when
        run in standalone mode, there may not even be a Python, but it's the
        same principle.

        So by default, this module is on and works around the behavior of the
        "multiprocessing.forking/multiprocessing.spawn" expectations.

On Windows, the multiprocessing modules forks new processes which then have
to start from scratch. This won't work if there is no "sys.executable" to
point to a "Python.exe" and won't use compiled code by default.

The issue applies to accelerated and standalone mode alike.

        Notes:
            Tensorflow is a very large package and mainly used to interactively
            create the actual application. Therefore, compilation makes no
            sense for it and the packages it references.

    This is a plug-in to make programs work well in standalone mode which are using tkinter.
    These programs require the presence of certain libraries written in the TCL language.
    On Windows platforms, and even on Linux, the existence of these libraries cannot be
    assumed. We therefore

    1. Copy the TCL libraries as sub-folders to the program's dist folder
    2. Redirect the program's tkinter requests to these library copies. This is
       done by setting appropriate variables in the os.environ dictionary.
       Tkinter will use these variable value to locate the library locations.

    Each time before the program issues an import to a tkinter module, we make
    sure, that the TCL environment variables are correctly set.

    Args:
        NuitkaPluginBase: the plugin template class we are inheriting.

    Notes:
        You can enforce using a specific TCL folder by using TCL_LIBRARY
        and a Tk folder by using TK_LIBRARY, but that ought to normally
        not be necessary.

    This codifies certain rules that files can have as suffixes or prefixes
    to make them be part of the set of tests executed for a version or not.

    Generally, an ening of "<major><minor>.py" indicates that it must be that

Does all the Python parsing and puts it into a tree structure for use in later
stages of the compilation process.

In the "nuitka.tree.TreeHelpers" module, the dispatching is happening. One function
deals with every node kind as found in the AST. The parsing is centered around
the module "ast" output.

Many higher level language features and translated into lower level ones.

In-place assignments, for loops, while loops, classes, complex calls, with
statements, and even or/and etc. are all translated to simpler constructs.

The output of this module is a node tree, which contains only relatively low
level operations. A property of the output is also an overlaid tree of provider
structure that indicates variable provision.

Classes are handled in a separate module. They are re-formulated into functions
producing dictionaries used to call the metaclass with.

Try/except/else statements are handled in a separate module. They are
re-formulated into using a temporary variable to track if the else branch
should execute.

Try/finally statements are handled in a separate module. They are re-formulated
to use a nested try/finally for (un)publishing the exception for Python3.

With statements are handled in a separate module. They are re-formulated into
special attribute lookups for "__enter__" and "__exit__", calls of them,
catching and passing in exceptions raised.

Ignoring plugin decision to compile top level package '%s'
as bytecode, the extension module entry point is technically
required to compiled.buildExprOnlyNodename '%s' is parameter and nonlocalbuildVariableReferenceNode%s: can't find '__main__' module in '%s'
buildBinaryOpNodename '%s' is %s and globaltbackbuildNumberNodehandleGlobalDeclarationNode'return' with argument inside generatorbuildFormattedValueNode The code of the module is too complex.

        It cannot be compiled, with recursive code, and therefore the bytecode
        should be used instead.

        Example of this is "idnadata".

<module site-packages.nuitka.tree.ReformulationWhileLoopStatements> Reformulation of while loop statements.

Loops in Nuitka have no condition attached anymore, so while loops are
re-formulated like this:

.. code-block:: python

    while condition:
        something()

.. code-block:: python

    while 1:
        if not condition:
            break

        something()

This is to totally remove the specialization of loops, with the condition moved
to the loop body in an initial conditional statement, which contains a ``break``
statement.

That achieves, that only ``break`` statements exit the loop, and allow for
optimization to remove always true loop conditions, without concerning code
generation about it, and to detect such a situation, consider e.g. endless
loops.

.. note::

   Loop analysis (not yet done) can then work on a reduced problem (which
   ``break`` statements are executed under what conditions) and is then
   automatically very general.

   The fact that the loop body may not be entered at all, is still optimized,
   but also in the general sense. Explicit breaks at the loop start and loop
   conditions are the same.

        In this phase, we can do some fix-ups and find errors. We might e.g.
        detect that a "del" was executed on a shared variable, which is not
        allowed for Python 2.x, so it must be caught. The parsing wouldn't do
        that.

        Also, frame objects for functions should learn their variable names.

        In class context, a reference to a variable must be obeyed immediately,

        not early closure case of a function, this will not be done and only

        Returns:
            Module name "package_name.module_name" or if "package_name" is None
            then simply "module_name".

    getShebangFromFile^#!\s*(.*?)\n<module site-packages.nuitka.utils.Shebang> Utils to work with shebang lines.

 Given a concrete shebang value, it will extract the binary used.

    Notes:
        This function is less relevant on Windows, because it will not use
        this method of determining the execution.

        This handles that many times people use `env` binary to search the
        PATH for an actual binary, e.g. `/usr/bin/env python3.7` where we
        would care most about the `python3.7` part and want to see through
        the `env` usage.
    Args:
        shebang: The shebang extracted with one of the methods to do so.
    Returns:
        The binary the kernel will use (Linux and compatible).
     Given source code, extract the shebang (#!) part.

    Notes:
        This function is less relevant on Windows, because it will not use
        this method of determining the execution. Still scripts aimed at
        multiple platforms will contain it and it can be used to e.g. guess
        the Python version expected, if it is a Python script at all.

        There are variants of the function that will work on filenames instead.
    Args:
        source_code: The source code as a unicode string
    Returns:
        The binary and arguments that the kernel will use (Linux and compatible).
     Given a filename, extract the shebang (#!) part from it.

Nuitka needs to do a couple of things with Windows resources, e.g. adding
and removing manifests amd copying icon image resources into the created
binary. For this purpose, we need to list, remove, add resources and extract
their data.

Previously we used the Windows SDK tools for this purpose, but for some tasks,
e.g. deleting unwanted manifest resources for include into the distribution,
we needed to do it manually. Also setting icon resources with images for
multiple resources proved to be not possible.

    Return a directory to store cached wheels for link

        Because there are M wheels for any one sdist, we provide a directory
        to cache them in, and then consult that directory when looking up
        cache hits.

        We only insert things into the cache if they have plausible version
        numbers, so that we don't contaminate the cache with things that were
        not unique. E.g. ./package might have dozens of installs done for it
        and build a version of 0.0...and if we built and cached a wheel, we'd
        end up using the same wheel even if the source has been edited.

    The requirements for anything installable are as follows:

     - we must be able to determine the requirement name
       (or we can't correctly handle the non-upgrade case).

     - for packages with setup requirements, we must also be able
       to determine their requirements without installing additional
       packages (for the same reason as run-time dependencies)

     - we must be able to create a Distribution object exposing the
       above metadata.

    1. If the URL looks suspiciously like an archive, send a HEAD first to

        matches_or_no_digestA collection of candidates, returned by `PackageFinder.find_best_candidate`.

    This class is only intended to be instantiated by CandidateEvaluator's
    `compute_best_candidate()` method.
    
        Function to pass as the `key` argument to a call to sorted() to sort
        InstallationCandidates by preference.

        Returns a tuple such that tuples sorting as greater using Python's
        default comparison operator are more preferred.

        The preference is as follows:

        First and foremost, candidates with allowed (matching) hashes are
        always preferred over candidates without matching hashes. This is
        because e.g. if the only candidate with an allowed hash is yanked,
        we still want to use that candidate.

        Second, excepting hash considerations, candidates that have been
        yanked (in the sense of PEP 592) are always less preferred than
        candidates that haven't been yanked. Then:

        If not finding wheels, they are sorted by version only.
        If finding wheels, then the sort order is by version, then:
          1. existing installs
          2. wheels ordered via Wheel.support_index_min(self._supported_tags)
          3. source archives
        If prefer_binary was set, then all wheels are sorted above sources.

        Note: it was considered to embed this logic into the Link
              comparison operators, but then different sdist links
              with the same version, would have to be considered equal

    allows a warning to be logged if there is a more preferred candidate

        As a side-effect of this method, the packages (and their dependencies)
        are downloaded, unpacked and prepared for installation. This
        preparation is done by ``pip.operations.prepare``.

        Once PyPI has static dependency metadata available, it would be
        possible to move the preparation to become a step separated from

        After calling this req_to_install will only have satisfied_by set to
        None if the req_to_install is to be upgraded/reinstalled etc. Any
        other value will be a dist recording the current thing installed that
        satisfies the requirement.

        Note that for vcs urls and the like we can't assess skipping in this
        routine - we simply identify that we need to pull the thing down,
        then later on it is pulled down and introspected to assess upgrade/

        Package {!r} requires a different Python: {} not in {!r}Dependency Resolution

The dependency resolution in pip is performed as follows:

for top-level requirements:
    a. only one spec allowed per project, regardless of conflicts or not.
       otherwise a "double requirement" exception is raised
    b. they override sub-dependency requirements.
for sub-dependencies

    Historically pip has had several entrypoints defined. Because of issues

    To alleviate this pain, and provide a mechanism for warning users and

    get_installed_distributions.<locals>.editable_test
    Get the site-packages location of this distribution. Generally
    this is dist.location, except in the case of develop-installed

    Convert a bytes (or text) path to text (unicode in Python 2) for display

    Return the path for the .egg-link file if it exists, otherwise, None.

    There's 3 scenarios:
    1) not in a virtualenv

    2) in a no-global virtualenv
       try to find in site_packages
    3) in a yes-global virtualenv
       try to find in site_packages, then site.USER_SITE
       (don't look in global location)

    For #1 and #3, there could be odd cases, where there's an egg-link in 2
    locations.

    This method will just return the first one found.

    old_tempdir_manager<{} {!r}>/Users/francois.nouaille/dev/osc-cli-curses/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip/_internal/utils/typing.pyFor neatly implementing static typing in pip.

`mypy` - the static type analysis tool we use - uses the `typing` module, which
provides core functionality fundamental to mypy's functioning.

Generally, `typing` would be imported at runtime and used in that fashion -
it acts as a no-op at runtime and does not have any run-time overhead by
design.

As it turns out, `typing` is not vendorable - it uses separate sources for
Python 2/Python 3. Thus, this codebase can not expect it to be present.
To work around this, mypy allows the typing import to be behind a False-y
optional to prevent it from running at runtime and type-comments can be used
to remove the need for the types to be accessible directly during runtime.

This module provides the False-y guard in a nicely named fashion so that a
curious maintainer can reach here to read this.

In pip, all static-typing related imports should be guarded as follows:

    from pip._internal.utils.typing import MYPY_CHECK_RUNNING

    if MYPY_CHECK_RUNNING:
        from typing import ...

    Helper to ensure that self.finish() gets called on keyboard interrupt.

    This allows downloads to be interrupted without leaving temporary state
    (like hidden cursors) behind.

    This class is similar to the progress library's existing SigIntMixin
    helper, but as of version 1.2, that helper has the following problems:

    1. It calls sys.exit().
    2. It discards the existing SIGINT handler completely.
    3. It leaves its own handler in place even after an uninterrupted finish,
       which will have unexpected delayed effects if the user triggers an
       unrelated keyboard interrupt some time after a progress-displaying
       download has already completed, for example.

        Parse the repository URL to use, and return the URL, revision,
        and auth info to use.

        Returns: (url, rev, (username, password)).
        <RevOptions {}: rev={!r}>
        Clean up current location and download the url repository
        (and vcs infos) into location

        :param url: the repository URL starting with a vcs prefix.
        
        Fetch a revision from a repository, in the case that this is the
        first fetch from the repository.

        Args:
          dest: the directory to fetch the repository to.
          rev_options: a RevOptions object.
        
        Update an already-existing repo to the given ``rev_options``.

        Args:
          rev_options: a RevOptions object.
        VersionControl.normalize_url
        Parse the repository URL's netloc, and return the new netloc to use
        along with auth information.

        Args:
          netloc: the original repository URL netloc.
          scheme: the repository URL's scheme without the vcs prefix.

        This is mainly for the Subversion class to override, so that auth
        information can be provided via the --username and --password options
        instead of through the URL.  For other subclasses like Git without
        such an option, auth information must stay in the URL.

        Returns: (netloc, (username, password)).
        VersionControl.get_remote_urlDetermine that %s uses VCS: %sVersionControl.run_command
        Return the RevOptions "extra arguments" to use in obtain().

    Find the path to `setup.py` by searching up the filesystem from `location`.
    Return the path to `setup.py` relative to `repo_root`.
    Return None if `setup.py` is in `repo_root` or cannot be found.
    VcsSupport.backends
        Return the VCS-specific command arguments.
        VersionControl.get_netloc_and_authChecking in %s for %s (%s)...VersionControl.obtain
    Encapsulates a VCS-specific revision to install, along with any VCS
    install options.

    Instances of this class should be treated as if immutable.
    
        Return true if the commit hash checked out at dest matches
        the revision in url.

        Always return False, if the VCS does not support immutable commit
        hashes.

        This method does not check if there are local uncommitted changes
        in dest after checkout, as pip currently has no use case for that.
        
        Return the revision string that should be used in a requirement.

        Return whether a directory path is a repository directory.
        
        Return whether the vcs prefix (e.g. "git+") should be added to a
        repository's remote url when used in a requirement.
        
        Return a RevOptions object.

        Args:
          rev: the name of a revision to install.

        Return a VersionControl object if a repository of that type is found
        at the given directory.
        
        Install or update in editable mode the package represented by this
        VersionControl object.

        :param dest: the repository directory in which to install or update.

    Return whether an InstallRequirement should be built into a wheel.<module site-packages.pip._vendor>site-packages.pip._vendor.appdirsEncode Windows paths to bytes. Only used on Python 2.

    Motivation is to be consistent with other operating systems where paths
    are also returned as bytes. This avoids problems mixing bytes and Unicode
    elsewhere in the codebase. For more details and discussion see
    <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3463>.

    If encoding using ASCII and MBCS fails, return the original Unicode path.
    ~/.config/<module site-packages.pip._vendor.appdirs>/Users/francois.nouaille/dev/osc-cli-curses/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip/_vendor/appdirs.pyReturn full path to the user-specific data dir for this application.

        "appname" is the name of application.
            If None, just the system directory is returned.
        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the
            appauthor or distributing body for this application. Typically
            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may
            pass False to disable it.
        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the
            path. You might want to use this if you want multiple versions
            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "roaming" (boolean, default False) can be set True to use the Windows
            roaming appdata directory. That means that for users on a Windows
            network setup for roaming profiles, this user data will be
            sync'd on login. See
            <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766489(WS.10).aspx>
            for a discussion of issues.

    Typical user data directories are:
        Mac OS X:               ~/Library/Application Support/<AppName>  # or ~/.config/<AppName>, if the other does not exist
        Unix:                   ~/.local/share/<AppName>    # or in $XDG_DATA_HOME, if defined
        Win XP (not roaming):   C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>
        Win XP (roaming):       C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>
        Win 7  (not roaming):   C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>
        Win 7  (roaming):       C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>

    For Unix, we follow the XDG spec and support $XDG_DATA_HOME.
    That means, by default "~/.local/share/<AppName>".

    name is the name of the format. function is the callable that will be
    used to create archives. If provided, extra_args is a sequence of
    (name, value) tuples that will be passed as arguments to the callable.
    description can be provided to describe the format, and will be returned
    by the get_archive_formats() function.

    If ignore_errors is set, errors are ignored; otherwise, if onerror
    is set, it is called to handle the error with arguments (func,
    path, exc_info) where func is os.listdir, os.remove, or os.rmdir;
    path is the argument to that function that caused it to fail; and
    exc_info is a tuple returned by sys.exc_info().  If ignore_errors
    is false and onerror is None, an exception is raised.

    Unpack an archive.

    `filename` is the name of the archive.

    `extract_dir` is the name of the target directory, where the archive
    is unpacked. If not provided, the current working directory is used.

    `format` is the archive format: one of "zip", "tar", or "gztar". Or any
    other registered format. If not provided, unpack_archive will use the
    filename extension and see if an unpacker was registered for that
    extension.

    In case none is found, a ValueError is raised.
    Recursively copy a directory tree.

    The destination directory must not already exist.
    If exception(s) occur, an Error is raised with a list of reasons.

    If the optional symlinks flag is true, symbolic links in the
    source tree result in symbolic links in the destination tree; if
    it is false, the contents of the files pointed to by symbolic
    links are copied. If the file pointed by the symlink doesn't
    exist, an exception will be added in the list of errors raised in
    an Error exception at the end of the copy process.

    You can set the optional ignore_dangling_symlinks flag to true if you
    want to silence this exception. Notice that this has no effect on
    platforms that don't support os.symlink.

    The optional ignore argument is a callable. If given, it
    is called with the `src` parameter, which is the directory
    being visited by copytree(), and `names` which is the list of
    `src` contents, as returned by os.listdir():

        callable(src, names) -> ignored_names

    Since copytree() is called recursively, the callable will be
    called once for each directory that is copied. It returns a
    list of names relative to the `src` directory that should
    not be copied.

    The optional copy_function argument is a callable that will be used
    to copy each file. It will be called with the source path and the
    destination path as arguments. By default, copy2() is used, but any
    function that supports the same signature (like copy()) can be used.

    'compress' must be "gzip" (the default), "bzip2", or None.

    'owner' and 'group' can be used to define an owner and a group for the
    archive that is being built. If not provided, the current owner and group
    will be used.

    The output tar file will be named 'base_name' +  ".tar", possibly plus
    the appropriate compression extension (".gz", or ".bz2").

    'base_name' is the name of the file to create, minus any format-specific
    extension; 'format' is the archive format: one of "zip", "tar", "bztar"
    or "gztar".

    'root_dir' is a directory that will be the root directory of the
    archive; ie. we typically chdir into 'root_dir' before creating the
    archive.  'base_dir' is the directory where we start archiving from;
    ie. 'base_dir' will be the common prefix of all files and
    directories in the archive.  'root_dir' and 'base_dir' both default
    to the current directory.  Returns the name of the archive file.

    'owner' and 'group' are used when creating a tar archive. By default,
    uses the current owner and group.

    `name` is the name of the format. `extensions` is a list of extensions
    corresponding to the format.

    `function` is the callable that will be
    used to unpack archives. The callable will receive archives to unpack.
    If it's unable to handle an archive, it needs to raise a ReadError
    exception.

    If provided, `extra_args` is a sequence of
    (name, value) tuples that will be passed as arguments to the callable.
    description can be provided to describe the format, and will be returned

    If the destination already exists but is not a directory, it may be

    If the destination is on our current filesystem, then rename() is used.
    Otherwise, src is copied to the destination and then removed.

    This is used mainly to distinguish platform-specific build directories and

    although the exact information included depends on the OS; eg. for IRIX
    the architecture isn't particularly important (IRIX only runs on SGI

           a filename or a TarInfo object. If `member' is a regular file, a
           file-like object is returned. If `member' is a link, a file-like
           object is constructed from the link's target. If `member' is none of
           the above, None is returned.
           The file-like object is read-only and provides the following
           methods: read(), readline(), readlines(), seek() and tell()

        The detect_encoding() function is used to detect the encoding that should
        be used to decode a Python source file.  It requires one argument, readline,
        in the same way as the tokenize() generator.

        It will call readline a maximum of twice, and return the encoding used
        (as a string) and a list of any lines (left as bytes) it has read in.

        It detects the encoding from the presence of a utf-8 bom or an encoding
        cookie as specified in pep-0263.  If both a bom and a cookie are present,
        but disagree, a SyntaxError will be raised.  If the encoding cookie is an
        invalid charset, raise a SyntaxError.  Note that if a utf-8 bom is found,
        'utf-8-sig' is returned.

        If no encoding is specified, then the default of 'utf-8' will be returned.

        A dictionary of shared locations whose keys are in the set 'prefix',
        'purelib', 'platlib', 'scripts', 'headers', 'data' and 'namespace'.
        The corresponding value is the absolute path of that category for
        this distribution, and takes into account any paths selected by the
        user at installation time (e.g. via command-line arguments). In the
        case of the 'namespace' key, this would be a list of absolute paths
        for the roots of namespace packages in this distribution.

                       ``'sha512'``. If no hasher is specified, the ``hasher``
                       attribute of the :class:`InstalledDistribution` instance
                       is used. If the hasher is determined to be ``None``, MD5
                       is used as the hashing algorithm.
        :returns: The hash of the data. If a hasher was explicitly specified,
                  the returned hash will be prefixed with the specified hasher
                  followed by '='.
        :rtype: str
        
    Represents a dependency graph between distributions.

    The dependency relationships are stored in an ``adjacency_list`` that maps
    distributions to a list of ``(other, label)`` tuples where  ``other``
    is a distribution and the edge is labeled with ``label`` (i.e. the version
    specifier, if such was provided). Also, for more efficient traversal, for
    every distribution ``x``, a list of predecessors is kept in
    ``reverse_list[x]``. An edge from distribution ``a`` to
    distribution ``b`` means that ``a`` depends on ``b``. If any missing
    dependencies are found, they are stored in ``missing``, which is a
    dictionary that maps distributions to a list of requirements that were not
    provided by any other distributions.

        PackageIndex.upload_file--local-user
        This is a convenience method for downloading a file from an URL.
        Normally, this will be a file from the index, though currently
        no check is made for this (i.e. a file can be downloaded from
        anywhere).

        The method is just like the :func:`urlretrieve` function in the
        standard library, except that it allows digest computation to be
        done during download and checking that the downloaded data
        matched any expected value.

        :param url: The URL of the file to be downloaded (assumed to be
                    available via an HTTP GET request).

                         saved.
        :param digest: If specified, this must be a (hasher, value)
                       tuple, where hasher is the algorithm used (e.g.
                       ``'md5'``) and ``value`` is the expected value.

    applying various patterns to what we find there.
    Select strings (presumably filenames) from 'self.files' that
        match 'pattern', a Unix-style wildcard (glob) pattern.

        Patterns are not quite the same as implemented by the 'fnmatch'
        module: '*' and '?'  match non-special characters, where "special"
        is platform-dependent: slash on Unix; colon, slash, and backslash on
        DOS/Windows; and colon on Mac OS.

        If 'anchor' is true (the default), then the pattern match is more
        stringent: "*.py" will match "foo.py" but not "foo/bar.py".  If
        'anchor' is false, both of these will match.

        If 'prefix' is supplied, then only filenames starting with 'prefix'
        (itself a pattern) and ending with 'pattern', with anything in between
        them, will match.  'anchor' is ignored in this case.

        If 'is_regex' is true, 'anchor' and 'prefix' are ignored, and
        'pattern' is assumed to be either a string containing a regex or a
        regex object -- no translation is done, the regex is just compiled
        and used as-is.

        Selected strings will be added to self.files.

        Return True if files are found.

        (which are platform-specific).

    This does a number of simple normalizations to the given string, based
    on observation of versions currently in use on PyPI. Given a dump of
    those version during PyCon 2009, 4287 of them:
    - 2312 (53.93%) match NormalizedVersion without change

        Update the contents of a wheel in a generic way. The modifier should
        be a callable which expects a dictionary argument: its keys are
        archive-entry paths, and its values are absolute filesystem paths
        where the contents the corresponding archive entries can be found. The
        modifier is free to change the contents of the files pointed to, add
        new entries and remove entries, before returning. This method will
        extract the entire contents of the wheel to a temporary location, call
        the modifier, and then use the passed (and possibly updated)
        dictionary to write a new wheel. If ``dest_dir`` is specified, the new
        wheel is written there -- otherwise, the original wheel is overwritten.

        The modifier should return True if it updated the wheel, else False.
        This method returns the same value the modifier returns.

    If you have a need to get distros for reliable IDs added into this set,
    or if you find that the :func:`distro.id` function returns a different
    distro ID for one of the listed distros, please create an issue in the
    `distro issue tracker`_.

    **Lookup hierarchy and transformations:**

    First, the ID is obtained from the following sources, in the specified
    order. The first available and non-empty value is used:

    * the value of the "ID" attribute of the os-release file,

    * the value of the "Distributor ID" attribute returned by the lsb_release
      command,

    * the first part of the file name of the distro release file,

    The so determined ID value then passes the following transformations,
    before it is returned by this method:

    * it is translated to lower case,

    * blanks (which should not be there anyway) are translated to underscores,

    * a normalization of the ID is performed, based upon
      `normalization tables`_. The purpose of this normalization is to ensure
      that the ID is as reliable as possible, even across incompatible changes
      in the OS distributions. A common reason for an incompatible change is
      the addition of an os-release file, or the addition of the lsb_release
      command, with ID values that differ from what was previously determined
      from the distro release file name.

    The dictionary structure and keys are always the same, regardless of which
    information items are available in the underlying data sources. The values
    for the various keys are as follows:

    * ``id``:  The result of :func:`distro.id`.

    * ``version``:  The result of :func:`distro.version`.

    * ``version_parts -> major``:  The result of :func:`distro.major_version`.

    * ``version_parts -> minor``:  The result of :func:`distro.minor_version`.

    * ``version_parts -> build_number``:  The result of
      :func:`distro.build_number`.

    * ``like``:  The result of :func:`distro.like`.

    * ``codename``:  The result of :func:`distro.codename`.

    For a description of the *pretty* and *best* parameters, see the
    :func:`distro.version` method.

    redhatenterpriseserverwordcharsLinuxDistribution.os_release_attrbasenames
The ``distro`` package (``distro`` stands for Linux Distribution) provides
information about the Linux distribution it runs on, such as a reliable
machine-readable distro ID, or version information.

It is the recommended replacement for Python's original
:py:func:`platform.linux_distribution` function, but it provides much more
functionality. An alternative implementation became necessary because Python
3.5 deprecated this function, and Python 3.8 will remove it altogether.
Its predecessor function :py:func:`platform.dist` was already
deprecated since Python 2.6 and will also be removed in Python 3.8.
Still, there are many cases in which access to OS distribution information
is needed. See `Python issue 1322 <https://bugs.python.org/issue1322>`_ for
more information.
LinuxDistribution._os_release_infoLinuxDistribution._parse_uname_content
        Parse a line from a distro release file.

        Parameters:
        * line: Line from the distro release file. Must be a unicode string
                or a UTF-8 encoded byte string.

        Returns:
            A dictionary containing all information items.
        LinuxDistribution.build_number(\d+)\.?(\d+)?\.?(\d+)?distribution_version
        Return the IDs of distributions that are like the OS distribution.

        For details, see :func:`distro.like`.
        enterpriseenterpriseredhatenterpriseworkstation
    Provides information about a OS distribution.

    This package creates a private module-global instance of this class with
    default initialization arguments, that is used by the
    `consolidated accessor functions`_ and `single source accessor functions`_.
    By using default initialization arguments, that module-global instance
    returns data about the current OS distribution (i.e. the distro this
    package runs on).

    Normally, it is not necessary to create additional instances of this class.
    However, in situations where control is needed over the exact data sources
    that are used, instances of this class can be created with a specific
    distro release file, or a specific os-release file, or without invoking the
    lsb_release command.
    LinuxDistribution._lsb_release_infoubuntu_codename_parse_os_release_content
        Return certain machine-readable information about the OS
        distribution.

        For details, see :func:`distro.info`.
        
    Return the codename for the release of the current OS distribution,
    as a string.

    If the distribution does not have a codename, an empty string is returned.

    Note that the returned codename is not always really a codename. For
    example, openSUSE returns "x86_64". This function does not handle such
    cases in any special way and just returns the string it finds, if any.

    **Lookup hierarchy:**

    * the codename within the "VERSION" attribute of the os-release file, if
      provided,

    * the value of the "Codename" attribute returned by the lsb_release
      command,

    * the value of the "<codename>" field of the distro release file.
    LinuxDistribution.minor_version
        Return a dictionary containing key-value pairs for the information
        items from the os-release file data source of the OS distribution.

        For details, see :func:`distro.os_release_info`.
        
    Return the name of the current OS distribution, as a human-readable
    string.

    If *pretty* is false, the name is returned without version or codename.
    (e.g. "CentOS Linux")

    If *pretty* is true, the version and codename are appended.
    (e.g. "CentOS Linux 7.1.1503 (Core)")

    **Lookup hierarchy:**

    The name is obtained from the following sources, in the specified order.
    The first available and non-empty value is used:

    * If *pretty* is false:

      - the value of the "NAME" attribute of the os-release file,

      - the value of the "Distributor ID" attribute returned by the lsb_release
        command,

      - the value of the "<name>" field of the distro release file.

    * If *pretty* is true:

      - the value of the "PRETTY_NAME" attribute of the os-release file,

      - the value of the "Description" attribute returned by the lsb_release
        command,

      - the value of the "<name>" field of the distro release file, appended
        with the value of the pretty version ("<version_id>" and "<codename>"
        fields) of the distro release file, if available.
    distributor_id
    Return a single named information item from the distro release file
    data source of the current OS distribution.

    Parameters:

    * ``attribute`` (string): Key of the information item.

    Returns:

    * (string): Value of the information item, if the item exists.
                The empty string, if the item does not exist.
    debian_versionLinuxDistribution.__repr__include_lsbLinuxDistribution.uname_infoLinuxDistribution.distro_release_attrLinuxDistribution._parse_os_release_contentLinuxDistribution.lsb_release_attr
    Return the major version of the current OS distribution, as a string,
    if provided.
    Otherwise, the empty string is returned. The major version is the first
    part of the dot-separated version string.

    For a description of the *best* parameter, see the :func:`distro.version`
    method.
    
        Return information about the OS distribution that is compatible
        with Python's :func:`platform.linux_distribution`, supporting a subset
        of its parameters.

        For details, see :func:`distro.linux_distribution`.
        
        Return the version of the OS distribution, as a tuple of version
        numbers.

        For details, see :func:`distro.version_parts`.
        _parse_lsb_release_content
        Return a dictionary containing key-value pairs for the information
        items from the distro release file data source of the OS
        distribution.

        For details, see :func:`distro.distro_release_info`.
        
        Return a single named information item from the os-release file data
        source of the OS distribution.

        For details, see :func:`distro.os_release_attr`.
        
        Return a single named information item from the uname command
        output data source of the OS distribution.

        For details, see :func:`distro.uname_release_attr`.
        
        Return the build number of the current distribution.

        For details, see :func:`distro.build_number`.
        LinuxDistribution.uname_attrLinuxDistribution._parse_distro_release_contentLinuxDistribution.distro_release_infoLinuxDistribution._uname_info
    Return a space-separated list of distro IDs of distributions that are
    closely related to the current OS distribution in regards to packaging
    and programming interfaces, for example distributions the current
    distribution is a derivative from.

    **Lookup hierarchy:**

    This information item is only provided by the os-release file.
    For details, see the description of the "ID_LIKE" attribute in the
    `os-release man page
    <http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html>`_.
    
        Parse a distro release file.

        Parameters:

        * filepath: Path name of the distro release file.

        Returns:
            A dictionary containing all information items.
        A version of @property which caches the value.  On access, it calls the
    underlying function and sets the value in `__dict__` so future accesses
    will not re-call the property.
    LinuxDistribution.info
        Return a dictionary containing key-value pairs for the information
        items from the lsb_release command data source of the OS
        distribution.

        For details, see :func:`distro.lsb_release_info`.
        distribution_codename
    Return a dictionary containing key-value pairs for the information items
    from the lsb_release command data source of the current OS distribution.

    See `lsb_release command output`_ for details about these information
    items.
    LinuxDistribution.likesystem-release
    Return the version of the current OS distribution, as a human-readable
    string.

    If *pretty* is false, the version is returned without codename (e.g.
    "7.0").

    If *pretty* is true, the codename in parenthesis is appended, if the
    codename is non-empty (e.g. "7.0 (Maipo)").

    Some distributions provide version numbers with different precisions in
    the different sources of distribution information. Examining the different
    sources in a fixed priority order does not always yield the most precise
    version (e.g. for Debian 8.2, or CentOS 7.1).

    The *best* parameter can be used to control the approach for the returned
    version:

    If *best* is false, the first non-empty version number in priority order of
    the examined sources is returned.

    If *best* is true, the most precise version number out of all examined
    sources is returned.

    **Lookup hierarchy:**

    In all cases, the version number is obtained from the following sources.
    If *best* is false, this order represents the priority order:

    * the value of the "VERSION_ID" attribute of the os-release file,
    * the value of the "Release" attribute returned by the lsb_release
      command,
    * the version number parsed from the "<version_id>" field of the first line
      of the distro release file,
    * the version number parsed from the "PRETTY_NAME" attribute of the
      os-release file, if it follows the format of the distro release files.
    * the version number parsed from the "Description" attribute returned by
      the lsb_release command, if it follows the format of the distro release
      files.
    LinuxDistribution._parse_lsb_release_content
        The initialization method of this class gathers information from the
        available data sources, and stores that in private instance attributes.
        Subsequent access to the information items uses these private instance
        attributes, so that the data sources are read only once.

        Parameters:

        * ``include_lsb`` (bool): Controls whether the
          `lsb_release command output`_ is included as a data source.

          If the lsb_release command is not available in the program execution
          path, the data source for the lsb_release command will be empty.

        * ``os_release_file`` (string): The path name of the
          `os-release file`_ that is to be used as a data source.

          An empty string (the default) will cause the default path name to
          be used (see `os-release file`_ for details).

          If the specified or defaulted os-release file does not exist, the
          data source for the os-release file will be empty.

        * ``distro_release_file`` (string): The path name of the
          `distro release file`_ that is to be used as a data source.

          An empty string (the default) will cause a default search algorithm
          to be used (see `distro release file`_ for details).

          If the specified distro release file does not exist, or if no default
          distro release file can be found, the data source for the distro
          release file will be empty.

        * ``include_name`` (bool): Controls whether uname command output is
          included as a data source. If the uname command is not available in
          the program execution path the data source for the uname command will
          be empty.

        Public instance attributes:

        * ``os_release_file`` (string): The path name of the
          `os-release file`_ that is actually used as a data source. The
          empty string if no distro release file is used as a data source.

        * ``distro_release_file`` (string): The path name of the
          `distro release file`_ that is actually used as a data source. The
          empty string if no distro release file is used as a data source.

        * ``include_lsb`` (bool): The result of the ``include_lsb`` parameter.
          This controls whether the lsb information will be loaded.

        * ``include_uname`` (bool): The result of the ``include_uname``
          parameter. This controls whether the uname information will
          be loaded.

        Raises:

        * :py:exc:`IOError`: Some I/O issue with an os-release file or distro
          release file.

        * :py:exc:`subprocess.CalledProcessError`: The lsb_release command had
          some issue (other than not being available in the program execution
          path).

        * :py:exc:`UnicodeError`: A data source has unexpected characters or
          uses an unexpected encoding.
        LinuxDistribution.__init__
    Return a single named information item from the os-release file data source
    of the current OS distribution.

    Parameters:

    * ``attribute`` (string): Key of the information item.

    Returns:

    * (string): Value of the information item, if the item exists.
      The empty string, if the item does not exist.

    See `os-release file`_ for details about these information items.
    lsb-release
    Return a dictionary containing key-value pairs for the information items
    from the distro release file data source of the current OS distribution.

    See `distro release file`_ for details about these information items.
    Codename: %s
        Get the information items from the specified distro release file.

        Returns:
            A dictionary containing all information items.
        
        Return a single named information item from the distro release file
        data source of the OS distribution.

        For details, see :func:`distro.distro_release_attr`.
        LinuxDistribution.linux_distributionOS distro info toolcall {} on an instance
    Return information about the current OS distribution as a tuple
    ``(id_name, version, codename)`` with items as follows:

    * ``id_name``:  If *full_distribution_name* is false, the result of
      :func:`distro.id`. Otherwise, the result of :func:`distro.name`.

    * ``version``:  The result of :func:`distro.version`.

    * ``codename``:  The result of :func:`distro.codename`.

    The interface of this function is compatible with the original
    :py:func:`platform.linux_distribution` function, supporting a subset of
    its parameters.

    The data it returns may not exactly be the same, because it uses more data
    sources than the original function, and that may lead to different data if
    the OS distribution is not consistent across multiple data sources it
    provides (there are indeed such distributions ...).

    Another reason for differences is the fact that the :func:`distro.id`
    method normalizes the distro ID string to a reliable machine-readable value
    for a number of popular OS distributions.

    This class takes care of character encoding and removing or replacing
    incorrect byte-sequences and also provides column and line tracking.

        HTMLInputStream(source, [encoding]) -> Normalized stream from source
        for use by html5lib.

        source can be either a file-object, local filename or a string.

        The optional encoding parameter must be a string that indicates
        the encoding.  If specified, that encoding will be used,
        regardless of any BOM or later declaration (such as in a meta
        element)

            Defaults to ``True``.

        :arg quote_attr_values: Whether to quote attribute values that don't
            require quoting per legacy browser behavior (``"legacy"``), when
            required by the standard (``"spec"``), or always (``"always"``).

            Defaults to ``"legacy"``.

        :arg quote_char: Use given quote character for attribute quoting.

            Defaults to ``"`` which will use double quotes unless attribute
            value contains a double quote, in which case single quotes are
            used.

        :arg escape_lt_in_attrs: Whether or not to escape ``<`` in attribute
            values.

            Defaults to ``False``.

            escaped within normal elements within rcdata elements such as
            style.

            Defaults to ``False``.

        :arg resolve_entities: Whether to resolve named character entities that
            appear in the source tree. The XML predefined entities &lt; &gt;
            &amp; &quot; &apos; are unaffected by this setting.

            Defaults to ``True``.

        :arg strip_whitespace: Whether to remove semantically meaningless
            whitespace. (This compresses all whitespace to a single space
            except within ``pre``.)

            Defaults to ``False``.

        :arg minimize_boolean_attributes: Shortens boolean attributes to give
            just the attribute value, for example::

              <input disabled="disabled">

            becomes::

              <input disabled>

            Defaults to ``True``.

        :arg use_trailing_solidus: Includes a close-tag slash at the end of the
            start tag of void elements (empty elements whose end tag is
            forbidden). E.g. ``<hr/>``.

            Defaults to ``False``.

        :arg space_before_trailing_solidus: Places a space immediately before
            the closing slash in a tag using a trailing solidus. E.g.
            ``<hr />``. Requires ``use_trailing_solidus=True``.

            Defaults to ``True``.

        :arg sanitize: Strip all unsafe or unknown constructs from output.
            See :py:class:`html5lib.filters.sanitizer.Filter`.

            Defaults to ``False``.

        :arg omit_optional_tags: Omit start/end tags that are optional.

            Defaults to ``True``.

        :arg alphabetical_attributes: Reorder attributes to be in alphabetical order.

        Loops through the addresses, collapsing concurrent netblocks.

    Example:

              '2001:db8::'
              are all functionally the same in IPv6.  That is to say,
              failing to provide a subnetmask will create an object with
              a mask of /128.

              Additionally, an integer can be passed, so

    Notes:
        The IPv?Interface classes describe an Address on a particular
        Network, so they're basically a combination of both the Address
        and Network classes.

              '192.0.0.2/0.0.0.255'
              are all functionally the same in IPv4. Similarly,

              '192.0.2.1/255.255.255.255'
              '192.0.2.1/32'
              are also functionally equivalent. That is to say, failing to
              provide a subnetmask will create an object with a mask of /32.

              If the mask (portion after the / in the argument) is given in
              dotted quad form, it is treated as a netmask if it starts with a
              non-zero field (e.g. /255.0.0.0 == /8) and as a hostmask if it
              starts with a zero field (e.g. 0.255.255.255 == /8), with the
              single exception of an all-zero mask which is treated as a
              netmask == /0. If no mask is given, a default of /32 is used.

              Additionally, an integer can be passed, so

    Address and Network objects are not sortable by default; they're

    doesn't make any sense.  There are some times however, where you may wish

        representation of the network addresses.  This means that the
        host bits aren't considered at all in this method.  If you want
        to compare host bits, you can easily enough do a
        'HostA._ip < HostB._ip'

        Args:
            other: An IP object.

        Returns:
            If the IP versions of self and other are the same, returns:

            -1 if self < other:

    usage:

        packer = Packer()
        astream.write(packer.pack(a))
        astream.write(packer.pack(b))

    Packer's constructor has some keyword arguments:

    :param callable default:
        Convert user type to builtin type that Packer supports.
        See also simplejson's document.

    :param bool use_single_float:
        Use single precision float type for float. (default: False)

    :param bool autoreset:
        Reset buffer after each pack and return its content as `bytes`. (default: True).
        If set this to false, use `bytes()` to get content and `.reset()` to clear buffer.

    :param bool use_bin_type:
        Use bin type introduced in msgpack spec 2.0 for bytes.
        It also enables str8 type for unicode.

    :param bool strict_types:
        If set to true, types will be checked to be exact. Derived classes
        from serializeable types will not be serialized and will be
        treated as unsupported type and forwarded to default.
        Additionally tuples will not be serialized as lists.
        This is useful when trying to implement accurate serialization
        for python types.

    :param str encoding:
        (deprecated) Convert unicode to bytes with this encoding. (default: 'utf-8')

    :param str unicode_errors:
        Error handler for encoding unicode. (default: 'strict')

    arguments:

    :param file_like:
        File-like object having `.read(n)` method.
        If specified, unpacker reads serialized data from it and :meth:`feed()` is not usable.

    :param int read_size:
        Used as `file_like.read(read_size)`. (default: `min(16*1024, max_buffer_size)`)

    :param bool use_list:
        If true, unpack msgpack array to Python list.
        Otherwise, unpack to Python tuple. (default: True)

    :param bool raw:
        If true, unpack msgpack raw to Python bytes (default).
        Otherwise, unpack to Python str (or unicode on Python 2) by decoding
        with UTF-8 encoding (recommended).
        Currently, the default is true, but it will be changed to false in
        near future.  So you must specify it explicitly for keeping backward
        compatibility.

        *encoding* option which is deprecated overrides this option.

    :param bool strict_map_key:
        If true, only str or bytes are accepted for map (dict) keys.
        It's False by default for backward-compatibility.
        But it will be True from msgpack 1.0.

    :param callable object_hook:
        When specified, it should be callable.
        Unpacker calls it with a dict argument after unpacking msgpack map.
        (See also simplejson)

    :param callable object_pairs_hook:
        When specified, it should be callable.
        Unpacker calls it with a list of key-value pairs after unpacking msgpack map.
        (See also simplejson)

    :param str encoding:
        Encoding used for decoding msgpack raw.
        If it is None (default), msgpack raw is deserialized to Python bytes.

    :param str unicode_errors:
        (deprecated) Used for decoding msgpack raw with *encoding*.
        (default: `'strict'`)

    :param int max_buffer_size:
        Limits size of data waiting unpacked.  0 means system's INT_MAX (default).
        Raises `BufferFull` exception when it is insufficient.
        You should set this parameter when unpacking data from untrusted source.

    :param int max_str_len:
        Deprecated, use *max_buffer_size* instead.
        Limits max length of str. (default: max_buffer_size or 1024*1024)

    :param int max_bin_len:
        Deprecated, use *max_buffer_size* instead.
        Limits max length of bin. (default: max_buffer_size or 1024*1024)

    :param int max_array_len:
        Limits max length of array.
        (default: max_buffer_size or 128*1024)

    :param int max_map_len:
        Limits max length of map.
        (default: max_buffer_size//2 or 32*1024)

    :param int max_ext_len:
        Deprecated, use *max_buffer_size* instead.
        Limits max size of ext type.  (default: max_buffer_size or 1024*1024)

    Example of streaming deserialize from file-like object::

        unpacker = Unpacker(file_like, raw=False, max_buffer_size=10*1024*1024)
        for o in unpacker:
            process(o)

    Example of streaming deserialize from socket::

        unpacker = Unpacker(raw=False, max_buffer_size=10*1024*1024)
        while True:
            buf = sock.recv(1024**2)
            if not buf:
                break

`mypy` - the static type analysis tool we use - uses the `typing` module, which
provides core functionality fundamental to mypy's functioning.

Generally, `typing` would be imported at runtime and used in that fashion -
it acts as a no-op at runtime and does not have any run-time overhead by
design.

As it turns out, `typing` is not vendorable - it uses separate sources for
Python 2/Python 3. Thus, this codebase can not expect it to be present.
To work around this, mypy allows the typing import to be behind a False-y
optional to prevent it from running at runtime and type-comments can be used
to remove the need for the types to be accessible directly during runtime.

This module provides the False-y guard in a nicely named fashion so that a
curious maintainer can reach here to read this.

In packaging, all static-typing related imports should be guarded as follows:

    from pip._vendor.packaging._typing import MYPY_CHECK_RUNNING

    if MYPY_CHECK_RUNNING:
        from typing import ...

         - ``expr[m, n]`` is equivalent to ``expr*(m, n)``
         - ``expr[n, ...]`` or ``expr[n,]`` is equivalent
              to ``expr*n + ZeroOrMore(expr)``
              (read as "at least n instances of ``expr``")
         - ``expr[..., n]`` is equivalent to ``expr*(0, n)``

        Note that ``expr[..., n]`` and ``expr[m, n]``do not raise an exception
        if more than ``n`` ``expr``s exist in the input stream.  If this behavior is

    Defined with string containing all allowed initial characters, an
    optional string containing allowed body characters (if omitted,
    defaults to the initial character set), and an optional minimum,
    maximum, and/or exact length.  The default value for ``min`` is
    1 (a minimum value < 1 is not valid); the default values for
    ``max`` and ``exact`` are 0, meaning no maximum or exact
    length restriction. An optional ``excludeChars`` parameter can
    list characters that might be found in the input ``bodyChars``
    string; useful to define a word of all printables except for one or
    two characters, for instance.

    :class:`srange` is useful for defining custom character set strings
    for defining ``Word`` expressions, using range notation from
    regular expression character sets.

    A common mistake is to use :class:`Word` to match a specific literal
    string, as in ``Word("Address")``. Remember that :class:`Word`
    uses the string argument to define *sets* of matchable characters.
    This expression would match "Add", "AAA", "dAred", or any other word
    made up of the characters 'A', 'd', 'r', 'e', and 's'. To match an
    exact literal string, use :class:`Literal` or :class:`Keyword`.

    pyparsing includes helper strings for building Words:

     - :class:`alphas`
     - :class:`nums`
     - :class:`alphanums`
     - :class:`hexnums`
     - :class:`alphas8bit` (alphabetic characters in ASCII range 128-255
       - accented, tilded, umlauted, etc.)
     - :class:`punc8bit` (non-alphabetic characters in ASCII range
       128-255 - currency, symbols, superscripts, diacriticals, etc.)
     - :class:`printables` (any non-whitespace character)

    Example::

        # a word composed of digits
        integer = Word(nums) # equivalent to Word("0123456789") or Word(srange("0-9"))

        # a word with a leading capital, and zero or more lowercase
        capital_word = Word(alphas.upper(), alphas.lower())

        # hostnames are alphanumeric, with leading alpha, and '-'
        hostname = Word(alphas, alphanums + '-')

        # roman numeral (not a strict parser, accepts invalid mix of characters)
        roman = Word("IVXLCDM")

        # any string of non-whitespace characters, except for ','
        csv_value = Word(printables, excludeChars=",")

        Execute the parse expression with the given string.
        This is the main interface to the client code, once the complete
        expression has been built.

        Returns the parsed data as a :class:`ParseResults` object, which may be
        accessed as a list, or as a dict or object with attributes if the given parser
        includes results names.

        If you want the grammar to require that the entire input string be
        successfully parsed, then set ``parseAll`` to True (equivalent to ending
        the grammar with ``StringEnd()``).

        Note: ``parseString`` implicitly calls ``expandtabs()`` on the input string,
        in order to report proper column numbers in parse actions.
        If the input string contains tabs and
        the grammar uses parse actions that use the ``loc`` argument to index into the
        string being parsed, you can ensure you have a consistent view of the input
        string by:

        - calling ``parseWithTabs`` on your grammar before calling ``parseString``
          (see :class:`parseWithTabs`)
        - define your parse action using the full ``(s, loc, toks)`` signature, and
          reference the input string using the parse action's ``s`` argument
        - explictly expand the tabs in your input string before calling
          ``parseString``

        Example::

            Word('a').parseString('aaaaabaaa')  # -> ['aaaaa']
            Word('a').parseString('aaaaabaaa', parseAll=True)  # -> Exception: Expected end of text
        
        Disables the skipping of whitespace before matching the characters in the
        :class:`ParserElement`'s defined pattern.  This is normally only used internally by
        the pyparsing module, but may be needed in some whitespace-sensitive grammars.
        
            Convenience wrapper assert to test a parser element and input string, and assert that
            the resulting ParseResults.asList() is equal to the expected_list.

    Token for skipping over all undefined text until the matched
    expression is found.

    Parameters:
     - expr - target expression marking the end of the data to be skipped
     - include - (default= ``False``) if True, the target expression is also parsed
          (the skipped text and target expression are returned as a 2-element list).
     - ignore - (default= ``None``) used to define grammars (typically quoted strings and
          comments) that might contain false matches to the target expression
     - failOn - (default= ``None``) define expressions that are not allowed to be
          included in the skipped test; if found before the target expression is found,
          the SkipTo is not a match

    Example::

        report = '''

    Token for matching words composed of characters *not* in a given
    set (will include whitespace in matched characters if not listed in
    the provided exclusion set - see example). Defined with string
    containing all disallowed characters, and an optional minimum,
    maximum, and/or exact length.  The default value for ``min`` is
    1 (a minimum value < 1 is not valid); the default values for
    ``max`` and ``exact`` are 0, meaning no maximum or exact
    length restriction.

    Example::

        # define a comma-separated-value as anything that is not a ','
        csv_value = CharsNotIn(',')
        print(delimitedList(csv_value).parseString("dkls,lsdkjf,s12 34,@!#,213"))

    prints::

    assertParseAndCheckList... [{0}]test_expr[+-]?(:?\d+\.\d*|\.\d+)MatchFirst.streamlineHelper to define a delimited list of expressions - the delimiter
    defaults to ','. By default, the list elements and delimiters can
    have intervening whitespace, and comments, but this can be
    overridden by passing ``combine=True`` in the constructor. If
    ``combine`` is set to ``True``, the matching tokens are
    returned as a single token string, with the delimiters included;
    otherwise, the matching tokens are returned as a list of tokens,
    with the delimiters suppressed.

    Example::

        delimitedList(Word(alphas)).parseString("aa,bb,cc") # -> ['aa', 'bb', 'cc']
        delimitedList(Word(hexnums), delim=':', combine=True).parseString("AA:BB:CC:DD:EE") # -> ['AA:BB:CC:DD:EE']

        Define one or more actions to perform when successfully matching parse element definition.
        Parse action fn is a callable method with 0-3 arguments, called as ``fn(s, loc, toks)`` ,
        ``fn(loc, toks)`` , ``fn(toks)`` , or just ``fn()`` , where:

        - s   = the original string being parsed (see note below)
        - loc = the location of the matching substring
        - toks = a list of the matched tokens, packaged as a :class:`ParseResults` object

        If the functions in fns modify the tokens, they can return them as the return
        value from fn, and the modified list of tokens will replace the original.
        Otherwise, fn does not need to return any value.

        If None is passed as the parse action, all previously added parse actions for this
        expression are cleared.

        Optional keyword arguments:
        - callDuringTry = (default= ``False``) indicate if parse action should be run during lookaheads and alternate testing

        Note: the default parsing behavior is to expand tabs in the input string
        before starting the parsing process.  See :class:`parseString for more
        information on parsing strings containing ``<TAB>`` s, and suggested
        methods to maintain a consistent view of the parsed string, the parse
        location, and line and column positions within the parsed string.

        Example::

            integer = Word(nums)
            date_str = integer + '/' + integer + '/' + integer

            date_str.parseString("1999/12/31")  # -> ['1999', '/', '12', '/', '31']

            # use parse action to convert to ints at parse time
            integer = Word(nums).setParseAction(lambda toks: int(toks[0]))
            date_str = integer + '/' + integer + '/' + integer

            # note that integer fields are now ints, not strings
            date_str.parseString("1999/12/31")  # -> [1999, '/', 12, '/', 31]
        _save_context
        Context manager to be used when writing unit tests that modify pyparsing config values:
         - packrat parsing
         - default whitespace characters.
         - default keyword characters
         - literal string auto-conversion class
         - __diag__ settings

        Example:
            with reset_pyparsing_context():
                # test that literals used to construct a grammar are automatically suppressed
                ParserElement.inlineLiteralsUsing(Suppress)

                term = Word(alphas) | Word(nums)
                group = Group('(' + term[...] + ')')

                # assert that the '()' characters are not included in the parsed tokens
                self.assertParseAndCheckLisst(group, "(abc 123 def)", ['abc', '123', 'def'])

        Pretty-printer for parsed results as a list, using the
        `pprint <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html>`_ module.
        Accepts additional positional or keyword args as defined for
        `pprint.pprint <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html#pprint.pprint>`_ .

        Example::

            func = Forward()
            term = ident | num | Group('(' + func + ')')

            result = func.parseString("fna a,b,(fnb c,d,200),100")
            result.pprint(width=40)

              '100']]
        
        Add sequence of elements to end of ParseResults list of elements.

        Example::

    A set of Unicode characters, for language-specific strings for
    ``alphas``, ``nums``, ``alphanums``, and ``printables``.
    A unicode_set is defined by a list of ranges in the Unicode character
    set, in a class attribute ``_ranges``, such as::

        _ranges = [(0x0020, 0x007e), (0x00a0, 0x00ff),]

    A unicode set can also be defined using multiple inheritance of other unicode sets::

        class CJK(Chinese, Japanese, Korean):
            pass
    
        Implementation of | operator - returns :class:`MatchFirst`

        unicode_set.numsUnicode set for Cyrillic Unicode Character Range
        Enable display of debugging messages while doing pattern matching.
        Set ``flag`` to True to enable, False to disable.

        Example::

            wd = Word(alphas).setName("alphaword")
            integer = Word(nums).setName("numword")
            term = wd | integer

            # turn on debugging for wd
            wd.setDebug()

            OneOrMore(term).parseString("abc 123 xyz 890")

        prints::

            Match alphaword at loc 0(1,1)
            Matched alphaword -> ['abc']
            Match alphaword at loc 3(1,4)
            Exception raised:Expected alphaword (at char 4), (line:1, col:5)
            Match alphaword at loc 7(1,8)
            Matched alphaword -> ['xyz']
            Match alphaword at loc 11(1,12)
            Exception raised:Expected alphaword (at char 12), (line:1, col:13)
            Match alphaword at loc 15(1,16)
            Exception raised:Expected alphaword (at char 15), (line:1, col:16)

        The output shown is that produced by the default debug actions - custom debug actions can be
        specified using :class:`setDebugActions`. Prior to attempting
        to match the ``wd`` expression, the debugging message ``"Match <exprname> at loc <n>(<line>,<col>)"``
        is shown. Then if the parse succeeds, a ``"Matched"`` message is shown, or an ``"Exception raised"``
        message is shown. Also note the use of :class:`setName` to assign a human-readable name to the expression,
        which makes debugging and exception messages easier to understand - for instance, the default
        name created for the :class:`Word` expression without calling ``setName`` is ``"W:(ABCD...)"``.
        Token to match a specified string, ignoring case of letters.
    Note: the matched results will always be in the case of the given
    match string, NOT the case of the input text.

    Example::

        OneOrMore(CaselessLiteral("CMD")).parseString("cmd CMD Cmd10") # -> ['CMD', 'CMD', 'CMD']

    (Contrast with example for :class:`CaselessKeyword`.)
    Matches if current position is at the beginning of a line within
    the parse string

    Example::

        test = '''\
        AAA this line
        AAA and this line
          AAA but not this one
        B AAA and definitely not this one
        '''

        for t in (LineStart() + 'AAA' + restOfLine).searchString(test):
            print(t)

    prints::

        ['AAA', ' this line']
        ['AAA', ' and this line']

        integer = Word(nums)

        Implementation of + operator - returns :class:`And`. Adding strings to a ParserElement
        converts them to :class:`Literal`s by default.

        Example::

            greet = Word(alphas) + "," + Word(alphas) + "!"
            hello = "Hello, World!"
            print (hello, "->", greet.parseString(hello))

        prints::

            Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']

        ``...`` may be used as a parse expression as a short form of :class:`SkipTo`.

            Literal('start') + ... + Literal('end')

        is equivalent to:

            Literal('start') + SkipTo('end')("_skipped*") + Literal('end')

        Note that the skipped text is returned with '_skipped' as a results name,
        and to support having multiple skips in the same parser, the value returned is
        a list of all skipped text.
        ParserElement.setParseAction.<locals>.<genexpr>Token to exactly match a specified string as a keyword, that is,
    it must be immediately followed by a non-keyword character.  Compare
    with :class:`Literal`:

     - ``Literal("if")`` will match the leading ``'if'`` in
       ``'ifAndOnlyIf'``.
     - ``Keyword("if")`` will not; it will only match the leading
       ``'if'`` in ``'if x=1'``, or ``'if(y==2)'``

    Accepts two optional constructor arguments in addition to the
    keyword string:

     - ``identChars`` is a string of characters that would be valid
       identifier characters, defaulting to all alphanumerics + "_" and
       "$"
     - ``caseless`` allows case-insensitive matching, default is ``False``.

    Example::

        Keyword("start").parseString("start")  # -> ['start']
        Keyword("start").parseString("starting")  # -> Exception

    For case-insensitive matching, use :class:`CaselessKeyword`.
    
        Implementation of ^ operator - returns :class:`Or`
        pyparsing_unicode.Japanese.KanjiParse action to remove HTML tags from web page HTML source

        Example::

            text = '<td>More info at the <a href="https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/wiki">pyparsing</a> wiki page</td>'
            td, td_end = makeHTMLTags("TD")
            table_text = td + SkipTo(td_end).setParseAction(pyparsing_common.stripHTMLTags)("body") + td_end
            print(table_text.parseString(text).body)

        reset_stack
        Method to take an exception and translate the Python internal traceback into a list
        of the pyparsing expressions that caused the exception to be raised.

        Parameters:

         - exc - exception raised during parsing (need not be a ParseException, in support
           of Python exceptions that might be raised in a parse action)
         - depth (default=16) - number of levels back in the stack trace to list expression
           and function names; if None, the full stack trace names will be listed; if 0, only
           the failing input line, marker, and exception string will be shown

        Returns a multi-line string listing the ParserElements and/or function names in the
        exception's stack trace.

        Note: the diagnostic output will include string representations of the expressions
        that failed to parse. These representations will be more helpful if you use `setName` to
        give identifiable names to your expressions. Otherwise they will use the default string
        forms, which may be cryptic to read.

        explain() is only supported under Python 3.

        _enable_all_warnings
        Method for quick testing of a parser against a test string. Good for simple

         - parseAll - (default= ``True``) - flag to pass to :class:`parseString` when running tests

        Example::

            expr = Word(nums)
            assert expr.matches("100")
        Helper method for defining space-delimited indentation blocks,
    such as those used to define block statements in Python source code.

    Parameters:

     - blockStatementExpr - expression defining syntax of statement that
       is repeated within the indented block
     - indentStack - list created by caller to manage indentation stack
       (multiple statementWithIndentedBlock expressions within a single
       grammar should share a common indentStack)
     - indent - boolean indicating whether block must be indented beyond
       the current level; set to False for block of left-most
       statements (default= ``True``)

    A valid block must contain at least one ``blockStatement``.

    Example::

        data = '''
        def A(z):
          A1
          B = 100
          G = A2
          A2
          A3
        B
        def BB(a,b,c):
          BB1
          def BBA():
            bba1
            bba2
            bba3
        C
        D
        def spam(x,y):
             def eggs(z):

        func_body = indentedBlock(stmt, indentStack)
        funcDef = Group(funcDecl + func_body)

        rvalue = Forward()
        funcCall = Group(identifier + "(" + Optional(delimitedList(rvalue)) + ")")
        rvalue << (funcCall | identifier | Word(nums))
        assignment = Group(identifier + "=" + rvalue)
        stmt << (funcDef | assignment | identifier)

        Regex.parseImplAsGroupList
        Make a copy of this :class:`ParserElement`.  Useful for defining
        different parse actions for the same parsing pattern, using copies of
        the original parse element.

        Example::

            integer = Word(nums).setParseAction(lambda toks: int(toks[0]))
            integerK = integer.copy().addParseAction(lambda toks: toks[0] * 1024) + Suppress("K")
            integerM = integer.copy().addParseAction(lambda toks: toks[0] * 1024 * 1024) + Suppress("M")

            print(OneOrMore(integerK | integerM | integer).parseString("5K 100 640K 256M"))

        prints::

            [5120, 100, 655360, 268435456]

        Equivalent form of ``expr.copy()`` is just ``expr()``::

            integerM = integer().addParseAction(lambda toks: toks[0] * 1024 * 1024) + Suppress("M")
        
        Overrides default behavior to expand ``<TAB>``s to spaces before parsing the input string.
        Must be called before ``parseString`` when the input grammar contains elements that
        match ``<TAB>`` characters.
        More than one string argument passed to oneOf, pass choices as a list or space-delimited string_get_chars_for_ranges
        Implementation of & operator when left operand is not a :class:`ParserElement`
        Helper to define a parse action by mapping a function to all
    elements of a ParseResults list. If any additional args are passed,
    they are forwarded to the given function as additional arguments
    after the token, as in
    ``hex_integer = Word(hexnums).setParseAction(tokenMap(int, 16))``,
    which will convert the parsed data to an integer using base 16.

    Example (compare the last to example in :class:`ParserElement.transformString`::

        hex_ints = OneOrMore(Word(hexnums)).setParseAction(tokenMap(int, 16))
        hex_ints.runTests('''
            00 11 22 aa FF 0a 0d 1a
            ''')

        upperword = Word(alphas).setParseAction(tokenMap(str.upper))
        OneOrMore(upperword).runTests('''
            my kingdom for a horse
            ''')

        wd = Word(alphas).setParseAction(tokenMap(str.title))
        OneOrMore(wd).setParseAction(' '.join).runTests('''
            now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york
            ''')

    prints::

        00 11 22 aa FF 0a 0d 1a
        [0, 17, 34, 170, 255, 10, 13, 26]

        my kingdom for a horse
        ['MY', 'KINGDOM', 'FOR', 'A', 'HORSE']

    \b%s\bMatches if the current position is at the end of a Word, and is
    not followed by any character in a given set of ``wordChars``
    (default= ``printables``). To emulate the ```` behavior of
    regular expressions, use ``WordEnd(alphanums)``. ``WordEnd``
    will also match at the end of the string being parsed, or at the end
    of a line.
    
        Implementation of + operator when left operand is not a :class:`ParserElement`
        infixNotation.<locals>._FB
            Unit test assertion to evaluate output of ParserElement.runTests(). If a list of
            list-dict tuples is given as the expected_parse_results argument, then these are zipped
            with the report tuples returned by runTests and evaluated using assertParseResultsEquals.
            Finally, asserts that the overall runTests() success value is True.

            :param run_tests_report: tuple(bool, [tuple(str, ParseResults or Exception)]) returned from runTests
            :param expected_parse_results (optional): [tuple(str, list, dict, Exception)]
            assertParseAndCheckDictSimplified version of :class:`withAttribute` when
    matching on a div class - made difficult because ``class`` is
    a reserved word in Python.

    Example::

        html = '''
            <div>
            Some text
            <div class="grid">1 4 0 1 0</div>
            <div class="graph">1,3 2,3 1,1</div>
            <div>this &lt;div&gt; has no class</div>
            </div>

        '''
        div,div_end = makeHTMLTags("div")
        div_grid = div().setParseAction(withClass("grid"))

        grid_expr = div_grid + SkipTo(div | div_end)("body")
        for grid_header in grid_expr.searchString(html):
            print(grid_header.body)

        div_any_type = div().setParseAction(withClass(withAttribute.ANY_VALUE))
        div_expr = div_any_type + SkipTo(div | div_end)("body")
        for div_header in div_expr.searchString(html):
            print(div_header.body)

    prints::

        1 4 0 1 0

        1 4 0 1 0
        1,3 2,3 1,1
    Returns current line number within a string, counting newlines as line separators.
    The first line is number 1.

    Note - the default parsing behavior is to expand tabs in the input string
    before starting the parsing process.  See :class:`ParserElement.parseString`
    for more information on parsing strings containing ``<TAB>`` s, and
    suggested methods to maintain a consistent view of the parsed string, the
    parse location, and line and column positions within the parsed string.
    _MultipleMatch._setResultsNamePrecededBy.__init__.<locals>.<lambda>Requires that at least one :class:`ParseExpression` is found. If
    two expressions match, the first one listed is the one that will
    match. May be constructed using the ``'|'`` operator.

    Example::

        # construct MatchFirst using '|' operator

        # watch the order of expressions to match
        number = Word(nums) | Combine(Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums))
        print(number.searchString("123 3.1416 789")) #  Fail! -> [['123'], ['3'], ['1416'], ['789']]

        # put more selective expression first
        number = Combine(Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums)) | Word(nums)
        print(number.searchString("123 3.1416 789")) #  Better -> [['123'], ['3.1416'], ['789']]
    
        Inserts new element at location index in the list of parsed tokens.

        Similar to ``list.insert()``.

        Example::

            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> ['0', '123', '321']

            # use a parse action to insert the parse location in the front of the parsed results
            def insert_locn(locn, tokens):
                tokens.insert(0, locn)
            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).addParseAction(insert_locn).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> [0, '0', '123', '321']
        Helper to decorate a returned token with its starting and ending
    locations in the input string.

    This helper adds the following results names:

     - locn_start = location where matched expression begins
     - locn_end = location where matched expression ends
     - value = the actual parsed results

    Be careful if the input text contains ``<TAB>`` characters, you
    may want to call :class:`ParserElement.parseWithTabs`

    Example::

        wd = Word(alphas)
        for match in locatedExpr(wd).searchString("ljsdf123lksdjjf123lkkjj1222"):
            print(match)

    prints::

        [[0, 'ljsdf', 5]]
        [[8, 'lksdjjf', 15]]
        [[18, 'lkkjj', 23]]
    _PendingSkip.__init__collect_all_And_tokensmissing <cannot use sub() with Regex(asGroupList=True)ParseExpression._setResultsName
        Returns the named parse results as a nested dictionary.

        Example::

            integer = Word(nums)
            date_str = integer("year") + '/' + integer("month") + '/' + integer("day")

            result = date_str.parseString('12/31/1999')
            print(type(result), repr(result)) # -> <class 'pyparsing.ParseResults'> (['12', '/', '31', '/', '1999'], {'day': [('1999', 4)], 'year': [('12', 0)], 'month': [('31', 2)]})

            result_dict = result.asDict()
            print(type(result_dict), repr(result_dict)) # -> <class 'dict'> {'day': '1999', 'year': '12', 'month': '31'}

            # even though a ParseResults supports dict-like access, sometime you just need to have a dict
            import json
            print(json.dumps(result)) # -> Exception: TypeError: ... is not JSON serializable
            print(json.dumps(result.asDict())) # -> {"month": "31", "day": "1999", "year": "12"}
        pyparsing_test.reset_pyparsing_context.saveHelper method for common parse actions that simply return
    a literal value.  Especially useful when used with
    :class:`transformString<ParserElement.transformString>` ().

    Example::

        num = Word(nums).setParseAction(lambda toks: int(toks[0]))
        na = oneOf("N/A NA").setParseAction(replaceWith(math.nan))
        term = na | num

        OneOrMore(term).parseString("324 234 N/A 234") # -> [324, 234, nan, 234]
    [+-]?(:?\d+(:?[eE][+-]?\d+)|(:?\d+\.\d*|\.\d+)(:?[eE][+-]?\d+)?)just like :class:`ParseFatalException`, but thrown internally
    when an :class:`ErrorStop<And._ErrorStop>` ('-' operator) indicates
    that parsing is to stop immediately because an unbacktrackable
    syntax error has been found.
    Regex.sub.<locals>.pa{0}.{1} - {2}
        Execute the parse expression on a series of test strings, showing each
        test, the parsed results or where the parse failed. Quick and easy way to
        run a parse expression against a list of sample strings.

        Parameters:
         - tests - a list of separate test strings, or a multiline string of test strings
         - parseAll - (default= ``True``) - flag to pass to :class:`parseString` when running tests
         - comment - (default= ``'#'``) - expression for indicating embedded comments in the test
              string; pass None to disable comment filtering
         - fullDump - (default= ``True``) - dump results as list followed by results names in nested outline;
              if False, only dump nested list
         - printResults - (default= ``True``) prints test output to stdout
         - failureTests - (default= ``False``) indicates if these tests are expected to fail parsing
         - postParse - (default= ``None``) optional callback for successful parse results; called as
              `fn(test_string, parse_results)` and returns a string to be added to the test output
         - file - (default=``None``) optional file-like object to which test output will be written;
              if None, will default to ``sys.stdout``

        Returns: a (success, results) tuple, where success indicates that all tests succeeded
        (or failed if ``failureTests`` is True), and the results contain a list of lines of each
        test's output

        Example::

            number_expr = pyparsing_common.number.copy()

            result = number_expr.runTests('''

            Success

        Each test string must be on a single line. If you want to test a string that spans multiple
        lines, create a test like this::

            expr.runTest(r"this is a test\n of strings that spans \n 3 lines")

        (Note that this is a raw string literal, you must include the leading 'r'.)
        Forward declaration of an expression to be defined later -
    used for recursive grammars, such as algebraic infix notation.
    When the expression is known, it is assigned to the ``Forward``
    variable using the '<<' operator.

    Note: take care when assigning to ``Forward`` not to overlook
    precedence of operators.

    Specifically, '|' has a lower precedence than '<<', so that::

        fwdExpr << a | b | c

    will actually be evaluated as::

        (fwdExpr << a) | b | c

    thereby leaving b and c out as parseable alternatives.  It is recommended that you
    explicitly group the values inserted into the ``Forward``::

        fwdExpr << (a | b | c)

    Converting to use the '<<=' operator instead will avoid this problem.

    See :class:`ParseResults.pprint` for an example of a recursive
    parser created using ``Forward``.
    infixNotation.<locals>._FB.parseImplOptional matching of the given expression.

    Parameters:
     - expr - expression that must match zero or more times
     - default (optional) - value to be returned if the optional expression is not found.

    Example::

        # US postal code can be a 5-digit zip, plus optional 4-digit qualifier
        zip = Combine(Word(nums, exact=5) + Optional('-' + Word(nums, exact=4)))
        zip.runTests('''

    Repetition of one or more of the given expression.

    Parameters:
     - expr - expression that must match one or more times
     - stopOn - (default= ``None``) - expression for a terminating sentinel
          (only required if the sentinel would ordinarily match the repetition
          expression)

    Example::

        data_word = Word(alphas)
        label = data_word + FollowedBy(':')
        attr_expr = Group(label + Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word).setParseAction(' '.join))

        text = "shape: SQUARE posn: upper left color: BLACK"
        OneOrMore(attr_expr).parseString(text).pprint()  # Fail! read 'color' as data instead of next label -> [['shape', 'SQUARE color']]

        # use stopOn attribute for OneOrMore to avoid reading label string as part of the data
        attr_expr = Group(label + Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word, stopOn=label).setParseAction(' '.join))
        OneOrMore(attr_expr).parseString(text).pprint() # Better -> [['shape', 'SQUARE'], ['posn', 'upper left'], ['color', 'BLACK']]

        # could also be written as
        (attr_expr * (1,)).parseString(text).pprint()
    Helper to define an expression that is indirectly defined from
    the tokens matched in a previous expression, that is, it looks for
    a 'repeat' of a previous expression.  For example::

        first = Word(nums)
        second = matchPreviousExpr(first)
        matchExpr = first + ":" + second

    will match ``"1:1"``, but not ``"1:2"``.  Because this
    matches by expressions, will *not* match the leading ``"1:1"``
    in ``"1:10"``; the expressions are evaluated first, and then
    compared, so ``"1"`` is compared with ``"10"``. Do *not* use
    with packrat parsing enabled.

            integer = Word(nums)
            ssn_expr = Regex(r"\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d\d\d")
            house_number_expr = Suppress('#') + Word(nums, alphanums)
            user_data = (Group(house_number_expr)("house_number")
                        | Group(ssn_expr)("ssn")
                        | Group(integer)("age"))
            user_info = OneOrMore(user_data)

            result = user_info.parseString("22 111-22-3333 #221B")
            for item in result:
                print(item.getName(), ':', item[0])

        prints::

            age : 22
            ssn : 111-22-3333
            house_number : 221B
        Regex.parseImplAsMatchParseException.explain
    Caseless version of :class:`Keyword`.

    Example::

        OneOrMore(CaselessKeyword("CMD")).parseString("cmd CMD Cmd10") # -> ['CMD', 'CMD']

    (Contrast with example for :class:`CaselessLiteral`.)
    
pyparsing module - Classes and methods to define and execute parsing grammars
=============================================================================

The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and
executing simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the
use of regular expressions.  With pyparsing, you don't need to learn
a new syntax for defining grammars or matching expressions - the parsing
module provides a library of classes that you use to construct the
grammar directly in Python.

Here is a program to parse "Hello, World!" (or any greeting of the form
``"<salutation>, <addressee>!"``), built up using :class:`Word`,
:class:`Literal`, and :class:`And` elements
(the :class:`'+'<ParserElement.__add__>` operators create :class:`And` expressions,
and the strings are auto-converted to :class:`Literal` expressions)::

    from pip._vendor.pyparsing import Word, alphas

    # define grammar of a greeting
    greet = Word(alphas) + "," + Word(alphas) + "!"

    hello = "Hello, World!"
    print (hello, "->", greet.parseString(hello))

The program outputs the following::

    Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']

The Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the
self-explanatory class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' operators.

The :class:`ParseResults` object returned from
:class:`ParserElement.parseString` can be
accessed as a nested list, a dictionary, or an object with named
attributes.

The pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically
vexing when writing text parsers:

  - extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle
    "Hello,World!", "Hello  ,  World  !", etc.)
  - quoted strings
  - embedded comments


Getting Started -
-----------------
Visit the classes :class:`ParserElement` and :class:`ParseResults` to
see the base classes that most other pyparsing
classes inherit from. Use the docstrings for examples of how to:

 - construct literal match expressions from :class:`Literal` and
   :class:`CaselessLiteral` classes
 - construct character word-group expressions using the :class:`Word`
   class
 - see how to create repetitive expressions using :class:`ZeroOrMore`
   and :class:`OneOrMore` classes
 - use :class:`'+'<And>`, :class:`'|'<MatchFirst>`, :class:`'^'<Or>`,
   and :class:`'&'<Each>` operators to combine simple expressions into
   more complex ones
 - associate names with your parsed results using
   :class:`ParserElement.setResultsName`
 - access the parsed data, which is returned as a :class:`ParseResults`
   object
 - find some helpful expression short-cuts like :class:`delimitedList`
   and :class:`oneOf`
 - find more useful common expressions in the :class:`pyparsing_common`
   namespace class
cannot multiply 'ParserElement' and ('%s', '%s') objectsHelper to create a validating parse action to be used with start
    tags created with :class:`makeXMLTags` or
    :class:`makeHTMLTags`. Use ``withAttribute`` to qualify
    a starting tag with a required attribute value, to avoid false
    matches on common tags such as ``<TD>`` or ``<DIV>``.

    Call ``withAttribute`` with a series of attribute names and
    values. Specify the list of filter attributes names and values as:

     - keyword arguments, as in ``(align="right")``, or
     - as an explicit dict with ``**`` operator, when an attribute
       name is also a Python reserved word, as in ``**{"class":"Customer", "align":"right"}``
     - a list of name-value tuples, as in ``(("ns1:class", "Customer"), ("ns2:align", "right"))``

    For attribute names with a namespace prefix, you must use the second
    form.  Attribute names are matched insensitive to upper/lower case.

    If just testing for ``class`` (with or without a namespace), use
    :class:`withClass`.

    To verify that the attribute exists, but without specifying a value,
    pass ``withAttribute.ANY_VALUE`` as the value.

    Example::

        html = '''
            <div>
            Some text
            <div type="grid">1 4 0 1 0</div>
            <div type="graph">1,3 2,3 1,1</div>
            <div>this has no type</div>
            </div>

        '''
        div,div_end = makeHTMLTags("div")

        # only match div tag having a type attribute with value "grid"
        div_grid = div().setParseAction(withAttribute(type="grid"))
        grid_expr = div_grid + SkipTo(div | div_end)("body")
        for grid_header in grid_expr.searchString(html):
            print(grid_header.body)

        # construct a match with any div tag having a type attribute, regardless of the value
        div_any_type = div().setParseAction(withAttribute(type=withAttribute.ANY_VALUE))
        div_expr = div_any_type + SkipTo(div | div_end)("body")
        for div_header in div_expr.searchString(html):
            print(div_header.body)

    prints::

        1 4 0 1 0

        1 4 0 1 0
        1,3 2,3 1,1
    pyparsing_unicode.DevanagariToken for matching strings that match a given regular
    expression. Defined with string specifying the regular expression in
    a form recognized by the stdlib Python  `re module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`_.
    If the given regex contains named groups (defined using ``(?P<name>...)``),
    these will be preserved as named parse results.

    If instead of the Python stdlib re module you wish to use a different RE module
    (such as the `regex` module), you can replace it by either building your
    Regex object with a compiled RE that was compiled using regex:

    Example::

        realnum = Regex(r"[+-]?\d+\.\d*")
        date = Regex(r'(?P<year>\d{4})-(?P<month>\d\d?)-(?P<day>\d\d?)')
        # ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/267399/how-do-you-match-only-valid-roman-numerals-with-a-regular-expression
        roman = Regex(r"M{0,4}(CM|CD|D?{0,3})(XC|XL|L?X{0,3})(IX|IV|V?I{0,3})")

        # use regex module instead of stdlib re module to construct a Regex using
        # a compiled regular expression
        import regex
        parser = pp.Regex(regex.compile(r'[0-9]'))

    frmSpecial matching class for matching whitespace.  Normally,
    whitespace is ignored by pyparsing grammars.  This class is included
    when some whitespace structures are significant.  Define with
    a string containing the whitespace characters to be matched; default
    is ``" \t\r\n"``.  Also takes optional ``min``,
    ``max``, and ``exact`` arguments, as defined for the
    :class:`Word` class.
    Abstract subclass of :class:`ParserElement`, for combining and
    post-processing parsed tokens.
    assertTrueall non-whitespace characters in this rangeAn empty token, will always match.
    Token to exactly match a specified string.

    Example::

        Literal('blah').parseString('blah')  # -> ['blah']
        Literal('blah').parseString('blahfooblah')  # -> ['blah']
        Literal('blah').parseString('bla')  # -> Exception: Expected "blah"

    For case-insensitive matching, use :class:`CaselessLiteral`.

    For keyword matching (force word break before and after the matched string),
    use :class:`Keyword` or :class:`CaselessKeyword`.
    Here are some common low-level expressions that may be useful in
    jump-starting parser development:

     - numeric forms (:class:`integers<integer>`, :class:`reals<real>`,
       :class:`scientific notation<sci_real>`)
     - common :class:`programming identifiers<identifier>`
     - network addresses (:class:`MAC<mac_address>`,
       :class:`IPv4<ipv4_address>`, :class:`IPv6<ipv6_address>`)
     - ISO8601 :class:`dates<iso8601_date>` and
       :class:`datetime<iso8601_datetime>`
     - :class:`UUID<uuid>`
     - :class:`comma-separated list<comma_separated_list>`

    Parse actions:

     - :class:`convertToInteger`
     - :class:`convertToFloat`
     - :class:`convertToDate`
     - :class:`convertToDatetime`
     - :class:`stripHTMLTags`
     - :class:`upcaseTokens`

    pyparsing_test.reset_pyparsing_context.__enter__
        Set class to be used for inclusion of string literals into a parser.

        Example::

            integer = Word(nums)
            date_str = integer("year") + '/' + integer("month") + '/' + integer("day")

        literal_string_classDecorator for debugging parse actions.

    When the parse action is called, this decorator will print
    ``">> entering method-name(line:<current_source_line>, <parse_location>, <matched_tokens>)"``.
    When the parse action completes, the decorator will print
    ``"<<"`` followed by the returned value, or any exception that the parse action raised.

    Example::

        wd = Word(alphas)

        @traceParseAction
        def remove_duplicate_chars(tokens):
            return ''.join(sorted(set(''.join(tokens))))

        wds = OneOrMore(wd).setParseAction(remove_duplicate_chars)

    given a tag name. Matches tags in either upper or lower case,
    attributes with namespaces and with quoted or unquoted values.

    Example::

        text = '<td>More info at the <a href="https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/wiki">pyparsing</a> wiki page</td>'
        # makeHTMLTags returns pyparsing expressions for the opening and

        Implementation of * operator, allows use of ``expr * 3`` in place of
        ``expr + expr + expr``.  Expressions may also me multiplied by a 2-integer
        tuple, similar to ``{min, max}`` multipliers in regular expressions.  Tuples
        may also include ``None`` as in:
         - ``expr*(n, None)`` or ``expr*(n, )`` is equivalent
              to ``expr*n + ZeroOrMore(expr)``
              (read as "at least n instances of ``expr``")
         - ``expr*(None, n)`` is equivalent to ``expr*(0, n)``
              (read as "0 to n instances of ``expr``")
         - ``expr*(None, None)`` is equivalent to ``ZeroOrMore(expr)``
         - ``expr*(1, None)`` is equivalent to ``OneOrMore(expr)``

        Note that ``expr*(None, n)`` does not raise an exception if
        more than n exprs exist in the input stream; that is,
        ``expr*(None, n)`` does not enforce a maximum number of expr
        occurrences.  If this behavior is desired, then write
        ``expr*(None, n) + ~expr``

Wrapper for parse actions, to ensure they are only called once.
    
        Generator method to split a string using the given expression as a separator.
        May be called with optional ``maxsplit`` argument, to limit the number of splits;
        and the optional ``includeSeparators`` argument (default= ``False``), if the separating
        matching text should be included in the split results.

        Example::

            punc = oneOf(list(".,;:/-!?"))
            print(list(punc.split("This, this?, this sentence, is badly punctuated!")))

        prints::

            ['This', ' this', '', ' this sentence', ' is badly punctuated', '']

        srange("[a-z]")   -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        srange("[a-z$_]") -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz$_"

    The input string must be enclosed in []'s, and the returned string
    is the expanded character set joined into a single string. The
    values enclosed in the []'s may be:

     - a single character
     - an escaped character with a leading backslash (such as ``\-``
       or ``\]``)
     - an escaped hex character with a leading ``'\x'``
       (``\x21``, which is a ``'!'`` character) (``\0x##``
       is also supported for backwards compatibility)
     - an escaped octal character with a leading ``'\0'``
       (``\041``, which is a ``'!'`` character)
     - a range of any of the above, separated by a dash (``'a-z'``,
       etc.)
     - any combination of the above (``'aeiouy'``,
       ``'a-zA-Z0-9_$'``, etc.)

        Another extension to :class:`scanString`, simplifying the access to the tokens found
        to match the given parse expression.  May be called with optional
        ``maxMatches`` argument, to clip searching after 'n' matches are found.

        Example::

            # a capitalized word starts with an uppercase letter, followed by zero or more lowercase letters
            cap_word = Word(alphas.upper(), alphas.lower())

            print(cap_word.searchString("More than Iron, more than Lead, more than Gold I need Electricity"))

            # the sum() builtin can be used to merge results into a single ParseResults object
            print(sum(cap_word.searchString("More than Iron, more than Lead, more than Gold I need Electricity")))

        prints::

            [['More'], ['Iron'], ['Lead'], ['Gold'], ['I'], ['Electricity']]
            ['More', 'Iron', 'Lead', 'Gold', 'I', 'Electricity']
        Enables "packrat" parsing, which adds memoizing to the parsing logic.
           Repeated parse attempts at the same string location (which happens
           often in many complex grammars) can immediately return a cached value,
           instead of re-executing parsing/validating code.  Memoizing is done of
           both valid results and parsing exceptions.

           Parameters:

           - cache_size_limit - (default= ``128``) - if an integer value is provided
             will limit the size of the packrat cache; if None is passed, then
             the cache size will be unbounded; if 0 is passed, the cache will
             be effectively disabled.

           This speedup may break existing programs that use parse actions that
           have side-effects.  For this reason, packrat parsing is disabled when
           you first import pyparsing.  To activate the packrat feature, your
           program must call the class method :class:`ParserElement.enablePackrat`.
           For best results, call ``enablePackrat()`` immediately after
           importing pyparsing.

           Example::

               from pip._vendor import pyparsing
               pyparsing.ParserElement.enablePackrat()
        pyparsing_unicode.Japanese.Katakanasuppress_LTasMatchUnicode set for Japanese Unicode Character Range, combining Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana ranges_SingleCharLiteral.parseImplStructured parse results, to provide multiple means of access to
    the parsed data:

       - as a list (``len(results)``)
       - by list index (``results[0], results[1]``, etc.)
       - by attribute (``results.<resultsName>`` - see :class:`ParserElement.setResultsName`)

    Example::

        integer = Word(nums)
        date_str = (integer.setResultsName("year") + '/'
                        + integer.setResultsName("month") + '/'
                        + integer.setResultsName("day"))
        # equivalent form:
        # date_str = integer("year") + '/' + integer("month") + '/' + integer("day")

        # parseString returns a ParseResults object
        result = date_str.parseString("1999/12/31")

        def test(s, fn=repr):
            print("%s -> %s" % (s, fn(eval(s))))
        test("list(result)")
        test("result[0]")
        test("result['month']")
        test("result.day")
        test("'month' in result")
        test("'minutes' in result")
        test("result.dump()", str)

    prints::

        result[0] -> '1999'
        result['month'] -> '12'

    Token for matching strings that are delimited by quoting characters.

    Defined with the following parameters:

        - quoteChar - string of one or more characters defining the
          quote delimiting string
        - escChar - character to escape quotes, typically backslash
          (default= ``None``)
        - escQuote - special quote sequence to escape an embedded quote
          string (such as SQL's ``""`` to escape an embedded ``"``)
          (default= ``None``)
        - multiline - boolean indicating whether quotes can span
          multiple lines (default= ``False``)
        - unquoteResults - boolean indicating whether the matched text
          should be unquoted (default= ``True``)
        - endQuoteChar - string of one or more characters defining the
          end of the quote delimited string (default= ``None``  => same as
          quoteChar)
        - convertWhitespaceEscapes - convert escaped whitespace
          (``'\t'``, ``'\n'``, etc.) to actual whitespace
          (default= ``True``)

    Example::

        qs = QuotedString('"')
        print(qs.searchString('lsjdf "This is the quote" sldjf'))
        complex_qs = QuotedString('{{', endQuoteChar='}}')
        print(complex_qs.searchString('lsjdf {{This is the "quote"}} sldjf'))
        sql_qs = QuotedString('"', escQuote='""')
        print(sql_qs.searchString('lsjdf "This is the quote with ""embedded"" quotes" sldjf'))

    prints::

        [['This is the quote']]
        [['This is the "quote"']]
        [['This is the quote with "embedded" quotes']]
    Unicode set for Chinese Unicode Character Range
        Extension to :class:`scanString`, to modify matching text with modified tokens that may
        be returned from a parse action.  To use ``transformString``, define a grammar and
        attach a parse action to it that modifies the returned token list.
        Invoking ``transformString()`` on a target string will then scan for matches,
        and replace the matched text patterns according to the logic in the parse
        action.  ``transformString()`` returns the resulting transformed string.

        Example::

            wd = Word(alphas)
            wd.setParseAction(lambda toks: toks[0].title())

            print(wd.transformString("now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york."))

        prints::

            Now Is The Winter Of Our Discontent Made Glorious Summer By This Sun Of York.
        _lazyclassproperty.__init__pyparsing_test.TestParseResultsAsserts.assertParseAndCheckDictMatchFirst.streamline.<locals>.<genexpr>Helper parse action for removing quotation marks from parsed
    quoted strings.

    Example::

        # by default, quotation marks are included in parsed results
        quotedString.parseString("'Now is the Winter of our Discontent'") # -> ["'Now is the Winter of our Discontent'"]

        # use removeQuotes to strip quotation marks from parsed results
        quotedString.setParseAction(removeQuotes)
        quotedString.parseString("'Now is the Winter of our Discontent'") # -> ["Now is the Winter of our Discontent"]
    A short-cut class for defining ``Word(characters, exact=1)``,
    when defining a match of any single character in a string of
    characters.
    Helper to quickly define a set of alternative Literals, and makes
    sure to do longest-first testing when there is a conflict,
    regardless of the input order, but returns
    a :class:`MatchFirst` for best performance.

    Parameters:

     - strs - a string of space-delimited literals, or a collection of
       string literals
     - caseless - (default= ``False``) - treat all literals as
       caseless
     - useRegex - (default= ``True``) - as an optimization, will
       generate a Regex object; otherwise, will generate
       a :class:`MatchFirst` object (if ``caseless=True`` or ``asKeyword=True``, or if
       creating a :class:`Regex` raises an exception)
     - asKeyword - (default=``False``) - enforce Keyword-style matching on the
       generated expressions

    Example::

        comp_oper = oneOf("< = > <= >= !=")
        var = Word(alphas)
        number = Word(nums)
        term = var | number
        comparison_expr = term + comp_oper + term
        print(comparison_expr.searchString("B = 12  AA=23 B<=AA AA>12"))

    prints::

        [['B', '=', '12'], ['AA', '=', '23'], ['B', '<=', 'AA'], ['AA', '>', '12']]
    unicode_set._get_chars_for_rangespackrat_parse
        Scan the input string for expression matches.  Each match will return the
        matching tokens, start location, and end location.  May be called with optional
        ``maxMatches`` argument, to clip scanning after 'n' matches are found.  If
        ``overlap`` is specified, then overlapping matches will be reported.

        Note that the start and end locations are reported relative to the string
        being parsed.  See :class:`parseString` for more information on parsing
        strings with embedded tabs.

        Example::

            source = "sldjf123lsdjjkf345sldkjf879lkjsfd987"
            print(source)
            for tokens, start, end in Word(alphas).scanString(source):
                print(' '*start + '^'*(end-start))
                print(' '*start + tokens[0])

        prints::

        And.streamlineReturns current column within a string, counting newlines as line separators.
   The first column is number 1.

   Note: the default parsing behavior is to expand tabs in the input string
   before starting the parsing process.  See
   :class:`ParserElement.parseString` for more
   information on parsing strings containing ``<TAB>`` s, and suggested
   methods to maintain a consistent view of the parsed string, the parse
   location, and line and column positions within the parsed string.
   cannot multiply ParserElement by 0 or (0, 0)
        Diagnostic method for listing out the contents of
        a :class:`ParseResults`. Accepts an optional ``indent`` argument so
        that this string can be embedded in a nested display of other data.

        Example::

            integer = Word(nums)
            date_str = integer("year") + '/' + integer("month") + '/' + integer("day")

            result = date_str.parseString('12/31/1999')
            print(result.dump())

        prints::

            ['12', '/', '31', '/', '1999']
            - day: 1999
            - month: 31
            - year: 12
        indentedBlock.<locals>.reset_stackParserElement.__getitem__Lookahead to disallow matching with the given parse expression.
    ``NotAny`` does *not* advance the parsing position within the
    input string, it only verifies that the specified parse expression
    does *not* match at the current position.  Also, ``NotAny`` does
    *not* skip over leading whitespace. ``NotAny`` always returns
    a null token list.  May be constructed using the '~' operator.

    Example::

        AND, OR, NOT = map(CaselessKeyword, "AND OR NOT".split())

        # take care not to mistake keywords for identifiers
        ident = ~(AND | OR | NOT) + Word(alphas)
        boolean_term = Optional(NOT) + ident

        # very crude boolean expression - to support parenthesis groups and
        # operation hierarchy, use infixNotation
        boolean_expr = boolean_term + ZeroOrMore((AND | OR) + boolean_term)

        # integers that are followed by "." are actually floats
        integer = Word(nums) + ~Char(".")
    pyparsing_test.reset_pyparsing_context.__exit__Helper to easily and clearly define a dictionary by specifying
    the respective patterns for the key and value.  Takes care of
    defining the :class:`Dict`, :class:`ZeroOrMore`, and
    :class:`Group` tokens in the proper order.  The key pattern
    can include delimiting markers or punctuation, as long as they are
    suppressed, thereby leaving the significant key text.  The value
    pattern can include named results, so that the :class:`Dict` results
    can include named token fields.

    Example::

        text = "shape: SQUARE posn: upper left color: light blue texture: burlap"
        attr_expr = (label + Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word, stopOn=label).setParseAction(' '.join))
        print(OneOrMore(attr_expr).parseString(text).dump())

        attr_label = label
        attr_value = Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word, stopOn=label).setParseAction(' '.join)

        # similar to Dict, but simpler call format
        result = dictOf(attr_label, attr_value).parseString(text)
        print(result.dump())
        print(result['shape'])
        print(result.shape)  # object attribute access works too
        print(result.asDict())

    prints::

        [['shape', 'SQUARE'], ['posn', 'upper left'], ['color', 'light blue'], ['texture', 'burlap']]
        - color: light blue
        - posn: upper left

        Define expression to be ignored (e.g., comments) while doing pattern
        matching; may be called repeatedly, to define multiple comment or other
        ignorable patterns.

        Example::

            patt = OneOrMore(Word(alphas))
            patt.parseString('ablaj /* comment */ lskjd') # -> ['ablaj']

    ``FollowedBy`` does *not* advance the parsing position within
    the input string, it only verifies that the specified parse
    expression matches at the current position.  ``FollowedBy``
    always returns a null token list. If any results names are defined
    in the lookahead expression, those *will* be returned for access by
    name.

    Example::

        # use FollowedBy to match a label only if it is followed by a ':'
        data_word = Word(alphas)
        label = data_word + FollowedBy(':')
        attr_expr = Group(label + Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word, stopOn=label).setParseAction(' '.join))

        OneOrMore(attr_expr).parseString("shape: SQUARE color: BLACK posn: upper left").pprint()

    parse actions must be callableHelper to define a counted list of expressions.

    This helper defines a pattern of the form::

        integer expr expr expr...

    where the leading integer tells how many expr expressions follow.
    The matched tokens returns the array of expr tokens as a list - the
    leading count token is suppressed.

    If ``intExpr`` is specified, it should be a pyparsing expression
    that produces an integer value.

    Example::

        countedArray(Word(alphas)).parseString('2 ab cd ef')  # -> ['ab', 'cd']

        # in this parser, the leading integer value is given in binary,
        # '10' indicating that 2 values are in the array
        binaryConstant = Word('01').setParseAction(lambda t: int(t[0], 2))
        countedArray(Word(alphas), intExpr=binaryConstant).parseString('10 ab cd ef')  # -> ['ab', 'cd']

            tag_bodyHelper method for defining nested lists enclosed in opening and
    closing delimiters ("(" and ")" are the default).

    Parameters:
     - opener - opening character for a nested list
       (default= ``"("``); can also be a pyparsing expression
     - closer - closing character for a nested list
       (default= ``")"``); can also be a pyparsing expression
     - content - expression for items within the nested lists
       (default= ``None``)
     - ignoreExpr - expression for ignoring opening and closing
       delimiters (default= :class:`quotedString`)

    If an expression is not provided for the content argument, the
    nested expression will capture all whitespace-delimited content
    between delimiters as a list of separate values.

    Use the ``ignoreExpr`` argument to define expressions that may
    contain opening or closing characters that should not be treated as
    opening or closing characters for nesting, such as quotedString or
    a comment expression.  Specify multiple expressions using an
    :class:`Or` or :class:`MatchFirst`. The default is
    :class:`quotedString`, but if no expressions are to be ignored, then
    pass ``None`` for this argument.

        passed as ``True``.

        If ``name` is omitted, same as calling :class:`copy`.

        Example::

            # these are equivalent
            userdata = Word(alphas).setResultsName("name") + Word(nums + "-").setResultsName("socsecno")
            userdata = Word(alphas)("name") + Word(nums + "-")("socsecno")
        Converter to return the matched tokens as a list - useful for
    returning tokens of :class:`ZeroOrMore` and :class:`OneOrMore` expressions.

    Example::

        ident = Word(alphas)
        num = Word(nums)
        term = ident | num
        func = ident + Optional(delimitedList(term))
        print(func.parseString("fn a, b, 100"))  # -> ['fn', 'a', 'b', '100']

        func = ident + Group(Optional(delimitedList(term)))
        print(func.parseString("fn a, b, 100"))  # -> ['fn', ['a', 'b', '100']]
    pyparsing_unicode.GreekHelper to define an expression that is indirectly defined from
    the tokens matched in a previous expression, that is, it looks for
    a 'repeat' of a previous expression.  For example::

        first = Word(nums)
        second = matchPreviousLiteral(first)
        matchExpr = first + ":" + second

    will match ``"1:1"``, but not ``"1:2"``.  Because this
    matches a previous literal, will also match the leading
    ``"1:1"`` in ``"1:10"``. If this is not desired, use
    :class:`matchPreviousExpr`. Do *not* use with packrat parsing
    enabled.
    Converter to concatenate all matching tokens to a single string.
    By default, the matching patterns must also be contiguous in the
    input string; this can be disabled by specifying
    ``'adjacent=False'`` in the constructor.

    Example::

        real = Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums)
        print(real.parseString('3.1416')) # -> ['3', '.', '1416']
        # will also erroneously match the following
        print(real.parseString('3. 1416')) # -> ['3', '.', '1416']

        real = Combine(Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums))
        print(real.parseString('3.1416')) # -> ['3.1416']
        # no match when there are internal spaces
        print(real.parseString('3. 1416')) # -> Exception: Expected W:(0123...)
    Or.streamline.<locals>.<genexpr>A variation on :class:`Literal` which matches "close" matches,
    that is, strings with at most 'n' mismatching characters.
    :class:`CloseMatch` takes parameters:

     - ``match_string`` - string to be matched
     - ``maxMismatches`` - (``default=1``) maximum number of
       mismatches allowed to count as a match

    The results from a successful parse will contain the matched text
    from the input string and the following named results:

     - ``mismatches`` - a list of the positions within the
       match_string where mismatches were found
     - ``original`` - the original match_string used to compare
       against the input string

    If ``mismatches`` is an empty list, then the match was an exact
    match.

    Example::

        patt = CloseMatch("ATCATCGAATGGA")
        patt.parseString("ATCATCGAAXGGA") # -> (['ATCATCGAAXGGA'], {'mismatches': [[9]], 'original': ['ATCATCGAATGGA']})
        patt.parseString("ATCAXCGAAXGGA") # -> Exception: Expected 'ATCATCGAATGGA' (with up to 1 mismatches) (at char 0), (line:1, col:1)

        # exact match
        patt.parseString("ATCATCGAATGGA") # -> (['ATCATCGAATGGA'], {'mismatches': [[]], 'original': ['ATCATCGAATGGA']})

        # close match allowing up to 2 mismatches
        patt = CloseMatch("ATCATCGAATGGA", maxMismatches=2)
        patt.parseString("ATCAXCGAAXGGA") # -> (['ATCAXCGAAXGGA'], {'mismatches': [[4, 9]], 'original': ['ATCATCGAATGGA']})
    Unicode set for Devanagari Unicode Character RangeconditionAsParseAction.<locals>.paunicode_set.alphas%r object is not iterableHelper to construct opening and closing tag expressions for XML,
    given a tag name. Matches tags only in the given upper/lower case.

    Example: similar to :class:`makeHTMLTags`
    
    Exception thrown when parse expressions don't match class;
    supported attributes by name are:
    - lineno - returns the line number of the exception text
    - col - returns the column number of the exception text
    - line - returns the line containing the exception text

    Example::

        try:
            Word(nums).setName("integer").parseString("ABC")
        except ParseException as pe:
            print(pe)
            print("column: {}".format(pe.col))

    prints::

       Expected integer (at char 0), (line:1, col:1)
        column: 1

    _PendingSkip.parseImpl
        Define name for referencing matching tokens as a nested attribute
        of the returned parse results.
        NOTE: this returns a *copy* of the original :class:`ParserElement` object;
        this is so that the client can define a basic element, such as an
        integer, and reference it in multiple places with different names.

        You can also set results names using the abbreviated syntax,
        ``expr("name")`` in place of ``expr.setResultsName("name")``
        - see :class:`__call__`.

        Example::

            date_str = (integer.setResultsName("year") + '/'
                        + integer.setResultsName("month") + '/'
                        + integer.setResultsName("day"))

            # equivalent form:
            date_str = integer("year") + '/' + integer("month") + '/' + integer("day")
        cannot use sub() with a callable with Regex(asMatch=True)
        Define name for this expression, makes debugging and exception messages clearer.

        Example::

            Word(nums).parseString("ABC")  # -> Exception: Expected W:(0123...) (at char 0), (line:1, col:1)
            Word(nums).setName("integer").parseString("ABC")  # -> Exception: Expected integer (at char 0), (line:1, col:1)
        
        Helper to create a parse action for converting parsed date string to Python datetime.date

        Params -
         - fmt - format to be passed to datetime.strptime (default= ``"%Y-%m-%d"``)

        Example::

            date_expr = pyparsing_common.iso8601_date.copy()
            date_expr.setParseAction(pyparsing_common.convertToDate())
            print(date_expr.parseString("1999-12-31"))

        prints::

            [datetime.date(1999, 12, 31)]
        Lookbehind matching of the given parse expression.
    ``PrecededBy`` does not advance the parsing position within the
    input string, it only verifies that the specified parse expression
    matches prior to the current position.  ``PrecededBy`` always
    returns a null token list, but if a results name is defined on the
    given expression, it is returned.

    Parameters:

     - expr - expression that must match prior to the current parse
       location
     - retreat - (default= ``None``) - (int) maximum number of characters
       to lookbehind prior to the current parse location

    If the lookbehind expression is a string, Literal, Keyword, or
    a Word or CharsNotIn with a specified exact or maximum length, then
    the retreat parameter is not required. Otherwise, retreat must be
    specified to give a maximum number of characters to look back from
    the current parse position for a lookbehind match.

    Example::

        # VB-style variable names with type prefixes
        int_var = PrecededBy("#") + pyparsing_common.identifier
        str_var = PrecededBy("$") + pyparsing_common.identifier

    Helper to undo pyparsing's default grouping of And expressions,
    even if all but one are non-empty.
    all alphanumeric characters in this range_WordRegex.parseImplunicode_set.alphanums
        Returns named result matching the given key, or if there is no
        such name, then returns the given ``defaultValue`` or ``None`` if no
        ``defaultValue`` is specified.

        Similar to ``dict.get()``.

        Example::

            integer = Word(nums)
            date_str = integer("year") + '/' + integer("month") + '/' + integer("day")

            result = date_str.parseString("1999/12/31")
            print(result.get("year")) # -> '1999'
            print(result.get("hour", "not specified")) # -> 'not specified'
            print(result.get("hour")) # -> None
        
        Removes and returns item at specified index (default= ``last``).
        Supports both ``list`` and ``dict`` semantics for ``pop()``. If
        passed no argument or an integer argument, it will use ``list``
        semantics and pop tokens from the list of parsed tokens. If passed
        a non-integer argument (most likely a string), it will use ``dict``
        semantics and pop the corresponding value from any defined results
        names. A second default return value argument is supported, just as in
        ``dict.pop()``.

        Example::

            def remove_first(tokens):
                tokens.pop(0)
            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> ['0', '123', '321']
            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).addParseAction(remove_first).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> ['123', '321']

            label = Word(alphas)
            patt = label("LABEL") + OneOrMore(Word(nums))
            print(patt.parseString("AAB 123 321").dump())

            # Use pop() in a parse action to remove named result (note that corresponding value is not
            # removed from list form of results)
            def remove_LABEL(tokens):
                tokens.pop("LABEL")
                return tokens
            patt.addParseAction(remove_LABEL)
            print(patt.parseString("AAB 123 321").dump())

        prints::

            ['AAB', '123', '321']
            - LABEL: AAB

            ['AAB', '123', '321']
        <module site-packages.pip._vendor.pyparsing>Helper to return the original, untokenized text for a given
    expression.  Useful to restore the parsed fields of an HTML start
    tag into the raw tag text itself, or to revert separate tokens with
    intervening whitespace back to the original matching input text. By
    default, returns astring containing the original parsed text.

    If the optional ``asString`` argument is passed as
    ``False``, then the return value is
    a :class:`ParseResults` containing any results names that
    were originally matched, and a single token containing the original
    matched text from the input string.  So if the expression passed to
    :class:`originalTextFor` contains expressions with defined
    results names, you must set ``asString`` to ``False`` if you
    want to preserve those results name values.

    Example::

        src = "this is test <b> bold <i>text</i> </b> normal text "
        for tag in ("b", "i"):
            opener, closer = makeHTMLTags(tag)
            patt = originalTextFor(opener + SkipTo(closer) + closer)
            print(patt.searchString(src)[0])

    prints::

        ['<b> bold <i>text</i> </b>']
        ['<i>text</i>']
    Helper method for constructing grammars of expressions made up of
    operators working in a precedence hierarchy.  Operators may be unary
    or binary, left- or right-associative.  Parse actions can also be
    attached to operator expressions. The generated parser will also
    recognize the use of parentheses to override operator precedences
    (see example below).

    Note: if you define a deep operator list, you may see performance
    issues when using infixNotation. See
    :class:`ParserElement.enablePackrat` for a mechanism to potentially
    improve your parser performance.

    Parameters:
     - baseExpr - expression representing the most basic element for the
       nested
     - opList - list of tuples, one for each operator precedence level
       in the expression grammar; each tuple is of the form ``(opExpr,
       numTerms, rightLeftAssoc, parseAction)``, where:

       - opExpr is the pyparsing expression for the operator; may also
         be a string, which will be converted to a Literal; if numTerms
         is 3, opExpr is a tuple of two expressions, for the two
         operators separating the 3 terms
       - numTerms is the number of terms for this operator (must be 1,
         2, or 3)
       - rightLeftAssoc is the indicator whether the operator is right
         or left associative, using the pyparsing-defined constants
         ``opAssoc.RIGHT`` and ``opAssoc.LEFT``.
       - parseAction is the parse action to be associated with
         expressions matching this operator expression (the parse action
         tuple member may be omitted); if the parse action is passed
         a tuple or list of functions, this is equivalent to calling
         ``setParseAction(*fn)``
         (:class:`ParserElement.setParseAction`)
     - lpar - expression for matching left-parentheses
       (default= ``Suppress('(')``)
     - rpar - expression for matching right-parentheses
       (default= ``Suppress(')')``)

    Example::

        # simple example of four-function arithmetic with ints and
        # variable names
        integer = pyparsing_common.signed_integer
        varname = pyparsing_common.identifier

        arith_expr = infixNotation(integer | varname,
            [
            ('-', 1, opAssoc.RIGHT),
            (oneOf('* /'), 2, opAssoc.LEFT),
            (oneOf('+ -'), 2, opAssoc.LEFT),
            ])

        arith_expr.runTests('''
            5+3*6
            (5+3)*6
            -2--11

    prints::

        [[5, '+', [3, '*', 6]]]

        (5+3)*6
        [[[5, '+', 3], '*', 6]]

    A class decorator that defines __unicode__ and __str__ methods under Python 2.
    Under Python 3 it does nothing.

    To support Python 2 and 3 with a single code base, define a __str__ method
    returning text and apply this decorator to the class.

This module provides a pool manager that uses Google App Engine's
`URLFetch Service <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch>`_.

Example usage::

    from pip._vendor.urllib3 import PoolManager
    from pip._vendor.urllib3.contrib.appengine import AppEngineManager, is_appengine_sandbox

    if is_appengine_sandbox():
        # AppEngineManager uses AppEngine's URLFetch API behind the scenes
        http = AppEngineManager()
    else:
        # PoolManager uses a socket-level API behind the scenes
        http = PoolManager()

    r = http.request('GET', 'https://google.com/')

There are `limitations <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch/#Python_Quotas_and_limits>`_ to the URLFetch service and it may not be
the best choice for your application. There are three options for using
urllib3 on Google App Engine:

1. You can use :class:`AppEngineManager` with URLFetch. URLFetch is
   cost-effective in many circumstances as long as your usage is within the
   limitations.
2. You can use a normal :class:`~urllib3.PoolManager` by enabling sockets.
   Sockets also have `limitations and restrictions
   <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sockets/   #limitations-and-restrictions>`_ and have a lower free quota than URLFetch.
   To use sockets, be sure to specify the following in your ``app.yaml``::

        env_variables:
            GAE_USE_SOCKETS_HTTPLIB : 'true'

3. If you are using `App Engine Flexible
<https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/>`_, you can use the standard
:class:`PoolManager` without any configuration or special environment variables.

    By default, this function does a lot of the same work that
    ``ssl.create_default_context`` does on Python 3.4+. It:

    - Disables SSLv2, SSLv3, and compression
    - Sets a restricted set of server ciphers

    If you wish to enable SSLv3, you can do::

        from pip._vendor.urllib3.util import ssl_
        context = ssl_.create_urllib3_context()
        context.options &= ~ssl_.OP_NO_SSLv3

    You can do the same to enable compression (substituting ``COMPRESSION``
    for ``SSLv3`` in the last line above).

    :param ssl_version:
        The desired protocol version to use. This will default to
        PROTOCOL_SSLv23 which will negotiate the highest protocol that both
        the server and your installation of OpenSSL support.
    :param cert_reqs:
        Whether to require the certificate verification. This defaults to
        ``ssl.CERT_REQUIRED``.
    :param options:
        Specific OpenSSL options. These default to ``ssl.OP_NO_SSLv2``,
        ``ssl.OP_NO_SSLv3``, ``ssl.OP_NO_COMPRESSION``.
    :param ciphers:
        Which cipher suites to allow the server to select.
    :returns:
        Constructed SSLContext object with specified options
    :rtype: SSLContext
    <module site-packages.pip._vendor.urllib3.util.ssl_>
    Resolves the argument to a numeric constant, which can be passed to
    the wrap_socket function/method from the ssl module.
    Defaults to :data:`ssl.CERT_NONE`.
    If given a string it is assumed to be the name of the constant in the
    :mod:`ssl` module or its abbreviation.
    (So you can specify `REQUIRED` instead of `CERT_REQUIRED`.
    If it's neither `None` nor a string we assume it is already the numeric
    constant which can directly be passed to wrap_socket.

The default 'Loader' for 'load(stream)' without further arguments can be unsafe.
Use 'load(stream, Loader=ruamel.yaml.Loader)' explicitly if that is OK.
Alternatively include the following in your code:

  import warnings
  warnings.simplefilter('ignore', ruamel.yaml.error.UnsafeLoaderWarning)

In most other cases you should consider using 'safe_load(stream)'MarkedYAMLError.__str__StreamMark.__init__
In YAML 1.1 floating point values should have a dot ('.') in their mantissa.
See the Floating-Point Language-Independent Type for YAML Version 1.1 specification
( http://yaml.org/type/float.html ). This dot is not required for JSON nor for YAML 1.2

Correct your float: "{}" on line: {}, column: {}

or alternatively include the following in your code:

  import warnings
  warnings.simplefilter('ignore', ruamel.yaml.error.MantissaNoDotYAML1_1Warning)

    Lightweight wrapper around lazily evaluated func(*args, **kwargs).

    func is only evaluated when any attribute of its return value is accessed.
    Every attribute access is passed through to the wrapped value.
    (This only excludes special cases like method-wrappers, e.g., __hash__.)
    The sole additional attribute is the lazy_self function which holds the
    return value (or, prior to evaluation, func and arguments), in its closure.

        Given a list of patterns, return a callable that will be true only if
        the input matches at least one of the patterns.
        Return a list all Python packages found within directory 'where'

        'where' is the root directory which will be searched for packages.  It
        should be supplied as a "cross-platform" (i.e. URL-style) path; it will
        be converted to the appropriate local path syntax.

        'exclude' is a sequence of package names to exclude; '*' can be used
        as a wildcard in the names, such that 'foo.*' will exclude all
        subpackages of 'foo' (but not 'foo' itself).

        'include' is a sequence of package names to include.  If it's
        specified, only the named packages will be included.  If it's not
        specified, all found packages will be included.  'include' can contain
        shell style wildcard patterns just like 'exclude'.

        Report whether another set contains this set.

        Example:
            >>> OrderedSet([1, 2, 3]).issubset({1, 2})
            False
            >>> OrderedSet([1, 2, 3]).issubset({1, 2, 3, 4})
            True

        OrderedSet._update_itemsitems_to_add
        Remove and return the last element from the set.

        Raises KeyError if the set is empty.

        Example:
            >>> oset = OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])
            >>> oset.pop()
            3
        items_to_removeOrderedSet.copy
        Replace the 'items' list of this OrderedSet with a new one, updating
        self.map accordingly.
        
        Returns all elements that are in this set but not the others.

        Example:
            >>> OrderedSet([1, 2, 3]).difference(OrderedSet([2]))
            OrderedSet([1, 3])
            >>> OrderedSet([1, 2, 3]).difference(OrderedSet([2]), OrderedSet([3]))
            OrderedSet([1])
            >>> OrderedSet([1, 2, 3]) - OrderedSet([2])
            OrderedSet([1, 3])
            >>> OrderedSet([1, 2, 3]).difference()
            OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])
        OrderedSet.issubset.<locals>.<genexpr>OrderedSet.__setstate__
        Report whether this set contains another set.

        Example:
            >>> OrderedSet([1, 2]).issuperset([1, 2, 3])
            False
            >>> OrderedSet([1, 2, 3, 4]).issuperset({1, 2, 3})
            True

            False
        
        Combines all unique items.
        Each items order is defined by its first appearance.

        Example:
            >>> oset = OrderedSet.union(OrderedSet([3, 1, 4, 1, 5]), [1, 3], [2, 0])
            >>> print(oset)
            OrderedSet([3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 0])
            >>> oset.union([8, 9])
            OrderedSet([3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 0, 8, 9])
            >>> oset | {10}

An OrderedSet is a custom MutableSet that remembers its order, so that every
entry has an index that can be looked up.

Based on a recipe originally posted to ActiveState Recipes by Raymond Hettiger,
and released under the MIT license.

        Example:
            >>> list(reversed(OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])))
            [3, 2, 1]
        
        Returns elements in common between all sets. Order is defined only
        by the first set.

        Example:
            >>> oset = OrderedSet.intersection(OrderedSet([0, 1, 2, 3]), [1, 2, 3])
            >>> print(oset)
            OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])
            >>> oset.intersection([2, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4])
            OrderedSet([2])
            >>> oset.intersection()
            OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])
        
        Return a shallow copy of this object.

        Example:
            >>> this = OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])
            >>> other = this.copy()
            >>> this == other
            True
            >>> this is other
            False
        
        Remove all items from this OrderedSet.
        <module site-packages.setuptools._vendor.ordered_set>get_loc
        Returns the number of unique elements in the ordered set

        Example:
            >>> len(OrderedSet([]))
            0
            >>> len(OrderedSet([1, 2]))
            2
        OrderedSet.__getitem__
        Remove an element.  Do not raise an exception if absent.

        The MutableSet mixin uses this to implement the .remove() method, which
        *does* raise an error when asked to remove a non-existent item.

        Example:
            >>> oset = OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])
            >>> oset.discard(2)
            >>> print(oset)
            OrderedSet([1, 3])
            >>> oset.discard(2)
            >>> print(oset)
            OrderedSet([1, 3])
        
        Update the set with the given iterable sequence, then return the index
        of the last element inserted.

        Example:
            >>> oset = OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])
            >>> oset.update([3, 1, 5, 1, 4])
            4
            >>> print(oset)
            OrderedSet([1, 2, 3, 5, 4])
        other_as_set
        Example:
            >>> list(iter(OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])))
            [1, 2, 3]
        OrderedSet.symmetric_difference
        Update this OrderedSet to remove items from another set, then
        add items from the other set that were not present in this set.

        Example:
            >>> this = OrderedSet([1, 4, 3, 5, 7])
            >>> other = OrderedSet([9, 7, 1, 3, 2])
            >>> this.symmetric_difference_update(other)
            >>> print(this)
            OrderedSet([4, 5, 9, 2])
        Don't know how to index an OrderedSet by %rOrderedSet.clear
        Get the item at a given index.

        If `index` is a slice, you will get back that slice of items, as a
        new OrderedSet.

        If `index` is a list or a similar iterable, you'll get a list of
        items corresponding to those indices. This is similar to NumPy's
        "fancy indexing". The result is not an OrderedSet because you may ask
        for duplicate indices, and the number of elements returned should be
        the number of elements asked for.

        Example:
            >>> oset = OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])
            >>> oset[1]
            2
        __index__OrderedSet.issuperset.<locals>.<genexpr>
    Are we being asked to look up a list of things, instead of a single thing?
    We check for the `__iter__` attribute so that this can cover types that
    don't have to be known by this module, such as NumPy arrays.

    Strings, however, should be considered as atomic values to look up, not
    iterables. The same goes for tuples, since they are immutable and therefore
    valid entries.

    We don't need to check for the Python 2 `unicode` type, because it doesn't
    have an `__iter__` attribute anyway.
    subkey
        Get the index of a given entry, raising an IndexError if it's not
        present.

        `key` can be an iterable of entries that is not a string, in which case
        this returns a list of indices.

        Example:
            >>> oset = OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])
            >>> oset.index(2)
            1
        OrderedSet.symmetric_difference_updatediff1diff2OrderedSet.__and__OrderedSet.differenceOrderedSet.intersection.<locals>.<genexpr>
        Returns true if the containers have the same items. If `other` is a
        Sequence, then order is checked, otherwise it is ignored.

        Example:
            >>> oset = OrderedSet([1, 3, 2])
            >>> oset == [1, 3, 2]
            True
            >>> oset == [1, 2, 3]
            False
            >>> oset == [2, 3]
            False
            >>> oset == OrderedSet([3, 2, 1])
            False
        
        Add `key` as an item to this OrderedSet, then return its index.

        If `key` is already in the OrderedSet, return the index it already
        had.

        Example:
            >>> oset = OrderedSet()
            >>> oset.append(3)
            0
            >>> print(oset)
            OrderedSet([3])
        
    An OrderedSet is a custom MutableSet that remembers its order, so that
    every entry has an index that can be looked up.

    Example:
        >>> OrderedSet([1, 1, 2, 3, 2])
        OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])
    
        Update this OrderedSet to keep only items in another set, preserving
        their order in this set.

        Example:
            >>> this = OrderedSet([1, 4, 3, 5, 7])
            >>> other = OrderedSet([9, 7, 1, 3, 2])
            >>> this.intersection_update(other)
            >>> print(this)
            OrderedSet([1, 3, 7])
        
        Return the symmetric difference of two OrderedSets as a new set.
        That is, the new set will contain all elements that are in exactly
        one of the sets.

        Their order will be preserved, with elements from `self` preceding
        elements from `other`.

        Example:
            >>> this = OrderedSet([1, 4, 3, 5, 7])
            >>> other = OrderedSet([9, 7, 1, 3, 2])
            >>> this.symmetric_difference(other)

        OrderedSet.difference_update
        Update this OrderedSet to remove items from one or more other sets.

        Example:

            >>> this.difference_update(OrderedSet([2, 4]))
            >>> print(this)

    `progress_filter` is a function taking two arguments: a source path
    internal to the archive ('/'-separated), and a filesystem path where it
    will be extracted.  The callback must return the desired extract path
    (which may be the same as the one passed in), or else ``None`` to skip
    that file or directory.  The callback can thus be used to report on the
    progress of the extraction, as well as to filter the items extracted or
    alter their extraction paths.

    `drivers`, if supplied, must be a non-empty sequence of functions with the
    same signature as this function (minus the `drivers` argument), that raise
    ``UnrecognizedFormat`` if they do not support extracting the designated
    archive type.  The `drivers` are tried in sequence until one is found that
    does not raise an error, or until all are exhausted (in which case
    ``UnrecognizedFormat`` is raised).  If you do not supply a sequence of
    drivers, the module's ``extraction_drivers`` constant will be used, which
    means that ``unpack_zipfile`` and ``unpack_tarfile`` will be tried, in that
    order.

    This is a version of setuptools.build_meta that endeavors to maintain backwards
    compatibility with pre-PEP 517 modes of invocation. It exists as a temporary
    bridge between the old packaging mechanism and the new packaging mechanism,
    and will eventually be removed.
    
        Replace
        distutils.dist.Distribution with this class
        for the duration of this context.
        sys_argv_0from setuptools import setup; setup()A PEP 517 interface to setuptools

Previously, when a user or a command line tool (let's call it a "frontend")
needed to make a request of setuptools to take a certain action, for
example, generating a list of installation requirements, the frontend would
would call "setup.py egg_info" or "setup.py bdist_wheel" on the command line.

PEP 517 defines a different method of interfacing with setuptools. Rather
than calling "setup.py" directly, the frontend should:

  1. Set the current directory to the directory with a setup.py file
  2. Import this module into a safe python interpreter (one in which
     setuptools can potentially set global variables or crash hard).
  3. Call one of the functions defined in PEP 517.

What each function does is defined in PEP 517. However, here is a "casual"
definition of the functions (this definition should not be relied on for
bug reports or API stability):

  - `build_wheel`: build a wheel in the folder and return the basename
  - `get_requires_for_build_wheel`: get the `setup_requires` to build
  - `prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel`: get the `install_requires`
  - `build_sdist`: build an sdist in the folder and return the basename
  - `get_requires_for_build_sdist`: get the `setup_requires` to build

Again, this is not a formal definition! Just a "taste" of the module.

    Fix any globally cached `dist_path` related data

    `dist_path` should be a path of a newly installed egg distribution (zipped
    or unzipped).

    sys.path_importer_cache contains finder objects that have been cached when
    importing data from the original distribution. Any such finders need to be
    cleared since the replacement distribution might be packaged differently,
    e.g. a zipped egg distribution might get replaced with an unzipped egg
    folder or vice versa. Having the old finders cached may then cause Python
    to attempt loading modules from the replacement distribution using an
    incorrect loader.

    zipimport.zipimporter objects are Python loaders charged with importing
    data packaged inside zip archives. If stale loaders referencing the
    original distribution, are left behind, they can fail to load modules from
    the replacement distribution. E.g. if an old zipimport.zipimporter instance
    is used to load data from a new zipped egg archive, it may cause the
    operation to attempt to locate the requested data in the wrong location -
    one indicated by the original distribution's zip archive directory
    information. Such an operation may then fail outright, e.g. report having
    read a 'bad local file header', or even worse, it may fail silently &
    return invalid data.

    zipimport._zip_directory_cache contains cached zip archive directory
    information for all existing zipimport.zipimporter instances and all such
    instances connected to the same archive share the same cached directory
    information.

    If asked, and the underlying Python implementation allows it, we can fix
    all existing zipimport.zipimporter instances instead of having to track
    them down and remove them one by one, by updating their shared cached zip
    archive directory information. This, of course, assumes that the
    replacement distribution is packaged as a zipped egg.

    If not asked to fix existing zipimport.zipimporter instances, we still do
    our best to clear any remaining zipimport.zipimporter related cached data
    that might somehow later get used when attempting to load data from the new
    distribution and thus cause such load operations to fail. Note that when
    tracking down such remaining stale data, we can not catch every conceivable
    usage from here, and we clear only those that we know of and have found to
    cause problems if left alive. Any remaining caches should be updated by
    whomever is in charge of maintaining them, i.e. they should be ready to
    handle us replacing their zip archives with new distributions at runtime.

        bad install directory or PYTHONPATH

        You are attempting to install a package to a directory that is not
        on PYTHONPATH and which Python does not read ".pth" files from.  The
        installation directory you specified (via --install-dir, --prefix, or
        the distutils default setting) was:

            %s

        and your PYTHONPATH environment variable currently contains:

            %r

        Here are some of your options for correcting the problem:

        * You can choose a different installation directory, i.e., one that is
          on PYTHONPATH or supports .pth files

        * You can add the installation directory to the PYTHONPATH environment
          variable.  (It must then also be on PYTHONPATH whenever you run
          Python and want to use the package(s) you are installing.)

        * You can set up the installation directory to support ".pth" files by
          using one of the approaches described here:

    Update zipimporter cache data for a given normalized path.

    Any sub-path entries are processed as well, i.e. those corresponding to zip
    archives embedded in other zip archives.

    Given updater is a callable taking a cache entry key and the original entry
    (after already removing the entry from the cache), and expected to update
    the entry and possibly return a new one to be inserted in its place.
    Returning None indicates that the entry should not be replaced with a new
    one. If no updater is given, the cache entries are simply removed without
    any additional processing, the same as if the updater simply returned None.

    This is an enhanced version of 'distutils.dist.Distribution' that
    effectively adds the following new optional keyword arguments to 'setup()':

     'install_requires' -- a string or sequence of strings specifying project
        versions that the distribution requires when installed, in the format
        used by 'pkg_resources.require()'.  They will be installed
        automatically when the package is installed.  If you wish to use
        packages that are not available in PyPI, or want to give your users an
        alternate download location, you can add a 'find_links' option to the
        '[easy_install]' section of your project's 'setup.cfg' file, and then
        setuptools will scan the listed web pages for links that satisfy the
        requirements.

     'extras_require' -- a dictionary mapping names of optional "extras" to the
        additional requirement(s) that using those extras incurs. For example,
        this::

            extras_require = dict(reST = ["docutils>=0.3", "reSTedit"])

        indicates that the distribution can optionally provide an extra
        capability called "reST", but it can only be used if docutils and
        reSTedit are installed.  If the user installs your package using
        EasyInstall and requests one of your extras, the corresponding
        additional requirements will be installed if needed.

     'features' **deprecated** -- a dictionary mapping option names to
        'setuptools.Feature'
        objects.  Features are a portion of the distribution that can be
        included or excluded based on user options, inter-feature dependencies,
        and availability on the current system.  Excluded features are omitted
        from all setup commands, including source and binary distributions, so
        you can create multiple distributions from the same source tree.
        Feature names should be valid Python identifiers, except that they may
        contain the '-' (minus) sign.  Features can be included or excluded
        via the command line options '--with-X' and '--without-X', where 'X' is
        the name of the feature.  Whether a feature is included by default, and
        whether you are allowed to control this from the command line, is
        determined by the Feature object.  See the 'Feature' class for more
        information.

     'test_suite' -- the name of a test suite to run for the 'test' command.
        If the user runs 'python setup.py test', the package will be installed,
        and the named test suite will be run.  The format is the same as
        would be used on a 'unittest.py' command line.  That is, it is the
        dotted name of an object to import and call to generate a test suite.

     'package_data' -- a dictionary mapping package names to lists of filenames
        or globs to use to find data files contained in the named packages.
        If the dictionary has filenames or globs listed under '""' (the empty
        string), those names will be searched for in every package, in addition
        to any names for the specific package.  Data files found using these
        names/globs will be installed along with the package, in the same
        location as the package.  Note that globs are allowed to reference
        the contents of non-package subdirectories, as long as you use '/' as
        a path separator.  (Globs are automatically converted to
        platform-specific paths at runtime.)

    In addition to these new keywords, this class also has several new methods
    for manipulating the distribution's contents.  For example, the 'include()'
    and 'exclude()' methods can be thought of as in-place add and subtract
    commands that add or remove packages, modules, extensions, and so on from
    the distribution.  They are used by the feature subsystem to configure the
    distribution for the included and excluded features.
    Distribution contains no modules or packages for Distribution._move_install_requirements_markers.<locals>.<genexpr>long_description_content_typeFeature %s: must define 'require_features', 'remove', or at least one of 'packages', 'py_modules', etc.
        For a requirement, return the 'extras_require' suffix for
        that requirement.
        
    **deprecated** -- The `Feature` facility was never completely implemented
    or supported, `has reported issues
    <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/58>`_ and will be removed in
    a future version.

    A subset of the distribution that can be excluded if unneeded/wanted

    Features are created using these keyword arguments:

      'description' -- a short, human readable description of the feature, to
         be used in error messages, and option help messages.

      'standard' -- if true, the feature is included by default if it is
         available on the current system.  Otherwise, the feature is only
         included if requested via a command line '--with-X' option, or if
         another included feature requires it.  The default setting is 'False'.

      'available' -- if true, the feature is available for installation on the
         current system.  The default setting is 'True'.

      'optional' -- if true, the feature's inclusion can be controlled from the
         command line, using the '--with-X' or '--without-X' options.  If
         false, the feature's inclusion status is determined automatically,
         based on 'availabile', 'standard', and whether any other feature
         requires it.  The default setting is 'True'.

      'require_features' -- a string or sequence of strings naming features
         that should also be included if this feature is included.  Defaults to
         empty list.  May also contain 'Require' objects that should be
         added/removed from the distribution.

      'remove' -- a string or list of strings naming packages to be removed
         from the distribution if this feature is *not* included.  If the
         feature *is* included, this argument is ignored.  This argument exists
         to support removing features that "crosscut" a distribution, such as
         defining a 'tests' feature that removes all the 'tests' subpackages
         provided by other features.  The default for this argument is an empty
         list.  (Note: the named package(s) or modules must exist in the base
         distribution when the 'setup()' function is initially called.)

      other keywords -- any other keyword arguments are saved, and passed to
         the distribution's 'include()' and 'exclude()' methods when the
         feature is included or excluded, respectively.  So, for example, you
         could pass 'packages=["a","b"]' to cause packages 'a' and 'b' to be
         added or removed from the distribution as appropriate.

    A feature must include at least one 'requires', 'remove', or other
    keyword argument.  Otherwise, it can't affect the distribution in any way.
    Note also that you can subclass 'Feature' to create your own specialized
    feature types that modify the distribution in other ways when included or
    excluded.  See the docstrings for the various methods here for more detail.
    Aside from the methods, the only feature attributes that distributions look
    at are 'description' and 'optional'.
    If there were any non-global "display-only" options
        (--help-commands or the metadata display options) on the command
        line, display the requested info and return true; else return
        false.

        Set the options for 'command_obj' from 'option_dict'.  Basically
        this means copying elements of a dictionary ('option_dict') to
        attributes of an instance ('command').

        'command_obj' must be a Command instance.  If 'option_dict' is not
        supplied, uses the standard option dictionary for this command
        (from 'self.command_options').

        Adapted from distutils.dist.Distribution.parse_config_files,
        this method provides the same functionality in subtly-improved
        ways.
        Distribution.parse_command_lineDistribution.parse_config_files():get_cmdline_optionsVerify that value is a dictionary of package names to glob lists
        On Python 2, much of distutils relies on string values being of
        type 'str' (bytes) and not unicode text. If the value can be safely
        encoded to bytes using the default encoding, prefer that.

        Why the default encoding? Because that value can be implicitly
        decoded back to text if needed.

        You may override this in a subclass to perform additional operations on
        the distribution.  This method will be called at most once per
        feature, and only after all included features have been asked to
        include themselves.
        Distribution._finalize_2to3_doctestsVerify that feature makes sense in context of distribution

        This method is called by the distribution just before it parses its
        command line.  It checks to ensure that the 'remove' attribute, if any,
        contains only valid package/module names that are present in the base
        distribution when 'setup()' is called.  You may override it in a
        subclass to perform any other required validation of the feature
        against a target distribution.

        For example, 'dist.exclude(py_modules=["x"])' would remove 'x' from
        the distribution's 'py_modules' attribute.  Excluding packages uses
        the 'exclude_package()' method, so all of the package's contained
        packages, modules, and extensions are also excluded.

        Currently, this method only supports exclusion from attributes that are
        lists or tuples.  If you need to add support for excluding from other
        attributes in this or a subclass, you can add an '_exclude_X' method,
        where 'X' is the name of the attribute.  The method will be called with
        the value passed to 'exclude()'.  So, 'dist.exclude(foo={"bar":"baz"})'
        will try to call 'dist._exclude_foo({"bar":"baz"})', which can then
        handle whatever special exclusion logic is needed.

        For example, 'dist.include(py_modules=["x"])' would add 'x' to

        `spec` may be a ``Requirement`` object, or a string containing a URL,
        an existing local filename, or a project/version requirement spec
        (i.e. the string form of a ``Requirement`` object).  If it is the URL
        of a .py file with an unambiguous ``#egg=name-version`` tag (i.e., one
        that escapes ``-`` as ``_`` throughout), a trivial ``setup.py`` is
        automatically created alongside the downloaded file.

        If `spec` is a ``Requirement`` object or a string containing a
        project/version requirement spec, this method returns the location of
        a matching distribution (possibly after downloading it to `tmpdir`).
        If `spec` is a locally existing file or directory name, it is simply
        returned unchanged.  If `spec` is a URL, it is downloaded to a subpath
        of `tmpdir`, and the local filename is returned.  Various errors may be
        raised if a problem occurs during downloading.

        `requirement` must be a ``pkg_resources.Requirement`` instance.
        If necessary, or if the `force_scan` flag is set, the requirement is
        searched for in the (online) package index as well as the locally
        installed packages.  If a distribution matching `requirement` is found,
        the returned distribution's ``location`` is the value you would have
        gotten from calling the ``download()`` method with the matching
        distribution's URL or filename.  If no matching distribution is found,
        ``None`` is returned.

        If the `source` flag is set, only source distributions and source
        checkout links will be considered.  Unless the `develop_ok` flag is
        set, development and system eggs (i.e., those using the ``.egg-info``
        format) will be ignored.

This module provides a pool manager that uses Google App Engine's
`URLFetch Service <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch>`_.

Example usage::

    from urllib3 import PoolManager
    from urllib3.contrib.appengine import AppEngineManager, is_appengine_sandbox

    if is_appengine_sandbox():
        # AppEngineManager uses AppEngine's URLFetch API behind the scenes
        http = AppEngineManager()
    else:
        # PoolManager uses a socket-level API behind the scenes
        http = PoolManager()

    r = http.request('GET', 'https://google.com/')

There are `limitations <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch/#Python_Quotas_and_limits>`_ to the URLFetch service and it may not be
the best choice for your application. There are three options for using
urllib3 on Google App Engine:

1. You can use :class:`AppEngineManager` with URLFetch. URLFetch is
   cost-effective in many circumstances as long as your usage is within the
   limitations.
2. You can use a normal :class:`~urllib3.PoolManager` by enabling sockets.
   Sockets also have `limitations and restrictions
   <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sockets/   #limitations-and-restrictions>`_ and have a lower free quota than URLFetch.
   To use sockets, be sure to specify the following in your ``app.yaml``::

        env_variables:
            GAE_USE_SOCKETS_HTTPLIB : 'true'

3. If you are using `App Engine Flexible
<https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/>`_, you can use the standard
:class:`PoolManager` without any configuration or special environment variables.

    By default, this function does a lot of the same work that
    ``ssl.create_default_context`` does on Python 3.4+. It:

    - Disables SSLv2, SSLv3, and compression
    - Sets a restricted set of server ciphers

    If you wish to enable SSLv3, you can do::

        from urllib3.util import ssl_
        context = ssl_.create_urllib3_context()
        context.options &= ~ssl_.OP_NO_SSLv3

    You can do the same to enable compression (substituting ``COMPRESSION``
    for ``SSLv3`` in the last line above).

    :param ssl_version:
        The desired protocol version to use. This will default to
        PROTOCOL_SSLv23 which will negotiate the highest protocol that both
        the server and your installation of OpenSSL support.
    :param cert_reqs:
        Whether to require the certificate verification. This defaults to
        ``ssl.CERT_REQUIRED``.
    :param options:
        Specific OpenSSL options. These default to ``ssl.OP_NO_SSLv2``,
        ``ssl.OP_NO_SSLv3``, ``ssl.OP_NO_COMPRESSION``.
    :param ciphers:
        Which cipher suites to allow the server to select.
    :returns:
        Constructed SSLContext object with specified options
    :rtype: SSLContext
    
    Resolves the argument to a numeric constant, which can be passed to
    the wrap_socket function/method from the ssl module.
    Defaults to :data:`ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`.
    If given a string it is assumed to be the name of the constant in the
    :mod:`ssl` module or its abbreviation.
    (So you can specify `REQUIRED` instead of `CERT_REQUIRED`.
    If it's neither `None` nor a string we assume it is already the numeric
    constant which can directly be passed to wrap_socket.

    Extracts the 4 metadataitems needed (name, version, pyversion, arch) from
    the installer filename and the name of the egg-info directory embedded in
    the zipfile (if any).

    The egginfo filename has the format::

        name-ver(-pyver)(-arch).egg-info

    The installer filename has the format::

        name-ver.arch(-pyver).exe

    Some things to note:

    1. The installer filename is not definitive. An installer can be renamed
       and work perfectly well as an installer. So more reliable data should
       be used whenever possible.
    2. The egg-info data should be preferred for the name and version, because
       these come straight from the distutils metadata, and are mandatory.
    3. The pyver from the egg-info data should be ignored, as it is
       constructed from the version of Python used to build the installer,
       which is irrelevant - the installer filename is correct here (even to
       the point that when it's not there, any version is implied).
    4. The architecture must be taken from the installer filename, as it is
       not included in the egg-info data.
    5. Architecture-neutral installers still have an architecture because the

This module contains function to analyse dynamic library
headers to extract system information

Currently only for MacOSX

Library file on macosx system starts with Mach-O or Fat field.
This can be distinguish by first 32 bites and it is called magic number.
Proper value of magic number is with suffix _MAGIC. Suffix _CIGAM means
reversed bytes order.
Both fields can occur in two types: 32 and 64 bytes.

FAT field inform that this library contains few version of library
(typically for different types version). It contains
information where Mach-O headers starts.

Each section started with Mach-O header contains one library
(So if file starts with this field it contains only one version).

After filed Mach-O there are section fields.
Each of them starts with two fields:
cmd - magic number for this command
cmdsize - total size occupied by this section information.

In this case only sections LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX (for macosx 10.13 and earlier)
and LC_BUILD_VERSION (for macosx 10.14 and newer) are interesting,
because them contains information about minimal system version.

Important remarks:
- For fat files this implementation looks for maximum number version.
  It not check if it is 32 or 64 and do not compare it with currently builded package.
  So it is possible to false report higher version that needed.
- All structures signatures are taken form macosx header files.
- I think that binary format will be more stable than `otool` output.
  and if apple introduce some changes both implementation will need to be updated.

    This enum represents the different categories language models for
    ``SingleByteCharsetProber`` put characters into.

    Anything less than CONTROL is considered a letter.
    Represent a list of integers as a sequence of ranges:
    ((start_0, end_0), (start_1, end_1), ...), such that the original
    integers are exactly those x such that start_i <= x < end_i for some i.

    Ranges are encoded as single integers (start << 32 | end), not as tuples.
    
    Provides a thread-safe dict-like container which maintains up to
    ``maxsize`` keys while throwing away the least-recently-used keys beyond
    ``maxsize``.

    :param maxsize:
        Maximum number of recent elements to retain.

    :param dispose_func:
        Every time an item is evicted from the container,
        ``dispose_func(value)`` is called.  Callback which will get called

        Scan the input string for expression matches.  Each match will return the
        matching tokens, start location, and end location.  May be called with optional
        C{maxMatches} argument, to clip scanning after 'n' matches are found.  If
        C{overlap} is specified, then overlapping matches will be reported.

        Note that the start and end locations are reported relative to the string
        being parsed.  See L{I{parseString}<parseString>} for more information on parsing
        strings with embedded tabs.

    Helper to define an expression that is indirectly defined from
    the tokens matched in a previous expression, that is, it looks
    for a 'repeat' of a previous expression.  For example::
        first = Word(nums)
        second = matchPreviousLiteral(first)
        matchExpr = first + ":" + second
    will match C{"1:1"}, but not C{"1:2"}.  Because this matches a
    previous literal, will also match the leading C{"1:1"} in C{"1:10"}.
    If this is not desired, use C{matchPreviousExpr}.

    Token for matching words composed of allowed character sets.
    Defined with string containing all allowed initial characters,
    an optional string containing allowed body characters (if omitted,
    defaults to the initial character set), and an optional minimum,
    maximum, and/or exact length.  The default value for C{min} is 1 (a
    minimum value < 1 is not valid); the default values for C{max} and C{exact}
    are 0, meaning no maximum or exact length restriction. An optional
    C{excludeChars} parameter can list characters that might be found in 
    the input C{bodyChars} string; useful to define a word of all printables
    except for one or two characters, for instance.
    
    L{srange} is useful for defining custom character set strings for defining 
    C{Word} expressions, using range notation from regular expression character sets.
    
    A common mistake is to use C{Word} to match a specific literal string, as in 
    C{Word("Address")}. Remember that C{Word} uses the string argument to define
    I{sets} of matchable characters. This expression would match "Add", "AAA",
    "dAred", or any other word made up of the characters 'A', 'd', 'r', 'e', and 's'.
    To match an exact literal string, use L{Literal} or L{Keyword}.

    pyparsing includes helper strings for building Words:
     - L{alphas}
     - L{nums}
     - L{alphanums}
     - L{hexnums}
     - L{alphas8bit} (alphabetic characters in ASCII range 128-255 - accented, tilded, umlauted, etc.)
     - L{punc8bit} (non-alphabetic characters in ASCII range 128-255 - currency, symbols, superscripts, diacriticals, etc.)
     - L{printables} (any non-whitespace character)

    Example::
        # a word composed of digits
        integer = Word(nums) # equivalent to Word("0123456789") or Word(srange("0-9"))
        
        # a word with a leading capital, and zero or more lowercase
        capital_word = Word(alphas.upper(), alphas.lower())

        # hostnames are alphanumeric, with leading alpha, and '-'
        hostname = Word(alphas, alphanums+'-')
        
        # roman numeral (not a strict parser, accepts invalid mix of characters)
        roman = Word("IVXLCDM")
        
        # any string of non-whitespace characters, except for ','
        csv_value = Word(printables, excludeChars=",")

Pyperclip

A cross-platform clipboard module for Python, with copy & paste functions for plain text.
By Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com
BSD License

Usage:
  import pyperclip
  pyperclip.copy('The text to be copied to the clipboard.')
  spam = pyperclip.paste()

  if not pyperclip.is_available():
    print("Copy functionality unavailable!")

On Windows, no additional modules are needed.
On Mac, the pyobjc module is used, falling back to the pbcopy and pbpaste cli
    commands. (These commands should come with OS X.).
On Linux, install xclip or xsel via package manager. For example, in Debian:
    sudo apt-get install xclip
    sudo apt-get install xsel

Otherwise on Linux, you will need the gtk or PyQt5/PyQt4 modules installed.

gtk and PyQt4 modules are not available for Python 3,
and this module does not work with PyGObject yet.

Note: There seems to be a way to get gtk on Python 3, according to:
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/697397/python3-is-not-supporting-gtk-module

Cygwin is currently not supported.

Security Note: This module runs programs with these names:
    - which
    - where
    - pbcopy
    - pbpaste
    - xclip
    - xsel
    - klipper
    - qdbus
A malicious user could rename or add programs with these names, tricking
Pyperclip into running them with whatever permissions the Python process has.

The new-style print function for Python 2.4 and 2.5.Add any headers needed by the connection. As of v2.0 this does
        nothing by default, but is left for overriding by users that subclass
        the :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed for use
        when subclassing the
        :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        :param request: The :class:`PreparedRequest <PreparedRequest>` to add headers to.
        :param kwargs: The keyword arguments from the call to send().
        
        A generator wrapper for the read() method. A call will block until
        ``amt`` bytes have been read from the connection or until the
        connection is closed.

        :param amt:
            How much of the content to read. The generator will return up to
            much data per iteration, but may return less. This is particularly
            likely when using compressed data. However, the empty string will
            never be returned.

        :param decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the

    Map each requirement to the extras that demanded it.
    
        Define one or more actions to perform when successfully matching parse element definition.
        Parse action fn is a callable method with 0-3 arguments, called as C{fn(s,loc,toks)},
        C{fn(loc,toks)}, C{fn(toks)}, or just C{fn()}, where:
         - s   = the original string being parsed (see note below)
         - loc = the location of the matching substring
         - toks = a list of the matched tokens, packaged as a C{L{ParseResults}} object
        If the functions in fns modify the tokens, they can return them as the return
        value from fn, and the modified list of tokens will replace the original.
        Otherwise, fn does not need to return any value.

        Optional keyword arguments:
         - callDuringTry = (default=C{False}) indicate if parse action should be run during lookaheads and alternate testing

        Note: the default parsing behavior is to expand tabs in the input string
        before starting the parsing process.  See L{I{parseString}<parseString>} for more information
        on parsing strings containing C{<TAB>}s, and suggested methods to maintain a
        consistent view of the parsed string, the parse location, and line and column
        positions within the parsed string.
        
        Example::
            integer = Word(nums)
            date_str = integer + '/' + integer + '/' + integer

            date_str.parseString("1999/12/31")  # -> ['1999', '/', '12', '/', '31']

            # use parse action to convert to ints at parse time
            integer = Word(nums).setParseAction(lambda toks: int(toks[0]))
            date_str = integer + '/' + integer + '/' + integer

            # note that integer fields are now ints, not strings
            date_str.parseString("1999/12/31")  # -> [1999, '/', 12, '/', 31]

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the

        .. note::

           by :class:`.RequestMethods`, such as :meth:`request`.

        .. note::

           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make

            POST requests, see HTTPConnectionPool.post_url for
            more convenience).

        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.

        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.

            Pass ``None`` to retry until you receive a response. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.

            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.

        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.

        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.

        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When False, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.

        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.

        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.

        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of
            ``response_kw.get('preload_content', True)``.

        :param chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.

        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        :param \**response_kw:

    Thread-safe connection pool for one host.

    :param host:
        Host used for this HTTP Connection (e.g. "localhost"), passed into
        :class:`httplib.HTTPConnection`.

    :param port:
        Port used for this HTTP Connection (None is equivalent to 80), passed
        into :class:`httplib.HTTPConnection`.

    :param strict:
        Causes BadStatusLine to be raised if the status line can't be parsed
        as a valid HTTP/1.0 or 1.1 status line, passed into
        :class:`httplib.HTTPConnection`.

        .. note::
           Only works in Python 2. This parameter is ignored in Python 3.

    :param timeout:
        Socket timeout in seconds for each individual connection. This can
        be a float or integer, which sets the timeout for the HTTP request,
        or an instance of :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout` which gives you more
        fine-grained control over request timeouts. After the constructor has
        been parsed, this is always a `urllib3.util.Timeout` object.

    :param maxsize:
        Number of connections to save that can be reused. More than 1 is useful
        in multithreaded situations. If ``block`` is set to False, more
        connections will be created but they will not be saved once they've
        been used.

    :param block:
        If set to True, no more than ``maxsize`` connections will be used at
        a time. When no free connections are available, the call will block
        until a connection has been released. This is a useful side effect for
        particular multithreaded situations where one does not want to use more
        than maxsize connections per host to prevent flooding.

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given
        explicitly.

    :param retries:
        Retry configuration to use by default with requests in this pool.

    :param _proxy:
        Parsed proxy URL, should not be used directly, instead, see
        :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.ProxyManager`"

    :param _proxy_headers:
        A dictionary with proxy headers, should not be used directly,
        instead, see :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.ProxyManager`"

    :param \**conn_kw:
        Additional parameters are used to create fresh :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection`,
        :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection` instances.
    Content-length
    Helper to easily define string ranges for use in Word construction.  Borrows
    syntax from regexp '[]' string range definitions::
        srange("[0-9]")   -> "0123456789"
        srange("[a-z]")   -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        srange("[a-z$_]") -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz$_"
    The input string must be enclosed in []'s, and the returned string is the expanded
    character set joined into a single string.
    The values enclosed in the []'s may be:
     - a single character
     - an escaped character with a leading backslash (such as C{\-} or C{\]})
     - an escaped hex character with a leading C{'\x'} (C{\x21}, which is a C{'!'} character) 
         (C{\0x##} is also supported for backwards compatibility) 
     - an escaped octal character with a leading C{'\0'} (C{\041}, which is a C{'!'} character)
     - a range of any of the above, separated by a dash (C{'a-z'}, etc.)
     - any combination of the above (C{'aeiouy'}, C{'a-zA-Z0-9_$'}, etc.)

MaxRetryError.__init__
        Enable display of debugging messages while doing pattern matching.
        Set C{flag} to True to enable, False to disable.

        Example::
            wd = Word(alphas).setName("alphaword")
            integer = Word(nums).setName("numword")
            term = wd | integer
            
            # turn on debugging for wd
            wd.setDebug()

            OneOrMore(term).parseString("abc 123 xyz 890")
        
        prints::
            Match alphaword at loc 0(1,1)
            Matched alphaword -> ['abc']
            Match alphaword at loc 3(1,4)
            Exception raised:Expected alphaword (at char 4), (line:1, col:5)
            Match alphaword at loc 7(1,8)
            Matched alphaword -> ['xyz']
            Match alphaword at loc 11(1,12)
            Exception raised:Expected alphaword (at char 12), (line:1, col:13)
            Match alphaword at loc 15(1,16)
            Exception raised:Expected alphaword (at char 15), (line:1, col:16)

        The output shown is that produced by the default debug actions - custom debug actions can be
        specified using L{setDebugActions}. Prior to attempting
        to match the C{wd} expression, the debugging message C{"Match <exprname> at loc <n>(<line>,<col>)"}
        is shown. Then if the parse succeeds, a C{"Matched"} message is shown, or an C{"Exception raised"}
        message is shown. Also note the use of L{setName} to assign a human-readable name to the expression,
        which makes debugging and exception messages easier to understand - for instance, the default
        name created for the C{Word} expression without calling C{setName} is C{"W:(ABCD...)"}.

    Provides a general-case interface for Requests sessions to contact HTTP and
    HTTPS urls by implementing the Transport Adapter interface. This class will
    usually be created by the :class:`Session <Session>` class under the
    covers.

    :param pool_connections: The number of urllib3 connection pools to cache.
    :param pool_maxsize: The maximum number of connections to save in the pool.
    :param max_retries: The maximum number of retries each connection
        should attempt. Note, this applies only to failed DNS lookups, socket
        connections and connection timeouts, never to requests where data has
        made it to the server. By default, Requests does not retry failed
        connections. If you need granular control over the conditions under
        which we retry a request, import urllib3's ``Retry`` class and pass
        that instead.
    :param pool_block: Whether the connection pool should block for connections.

        ``VersionConflict`` if an unsuitable version of the project is already
        active in the specified `working_set`.)  If a suitable distribution
        isn't active, this method returns the newest distribution in the
        environment that meets the ``Requirement`` in `req`.  If no suitable
        distribution is found, and `installer` is supplied, then the result of
        calling the environment's ``obtain(req, installer)`` method will be
        returned.
        
    A stub function for copy(), which will load the real copy() function when
    called so that the real copy() function is used for later calls.

    This allows users to import pyperclip without having determine_clipboard()
    automatically run, which will automatically select a clipboard mechanism.
    This could be a problem if it selects, say, the memory-heavy PyQt4 module
    but the user was just going to immediately call set_clipboard() to use a
    different clipboard mechanism.

    The lazy loading this stub function implements gives the user a chance to
    call set_clipboard() to pick another clipboard mechanism. Or, if the user
    simply calls copy() or paste() without calling set_clipboard() first,
    will fall back on whatever clipboard mechanism that determine_clipboard()
    automatically chooses.

This module contains provisional support for SOCKS proxies from within
urllib3. This module supports SOCKS4, SOCKS4A (an extension of SOCKS4), and
SOCKS5. To enable its functionality, either install PySocks or install this
module with the ``socks`` extra.

The SOCKS implementation supports the full range of urllib3 features. It also
supports the following SOCKS features:

- SOCKS4A (``proxy_url='socks4a://...``)
- SOCKS4 (``proxy_url='socks4://...``)
- SOCKS5 with remote DNS (``proxy_url='socks5h://...``)
- SOCKS5 with local DNS (``proxy_url='socks5://...``)
- Usernames and passwords for the SOCKS proxy

 .. note::
    It is recommended to use ``socks5h://`` or ``socks4a://`` schemes in
    your ``proxy_url`` to ensure that DNS resolution is done from the remote
    server instead of client-side when connecting to a domain name.

SOCKS4 supports IPv4 and domain names with the SOCKS4A extension. SOCKS5
supports IPv4, IPv6, and domain names.

When connecting to a SOCKS4 proxy the ``username`` portion of the ``proxy_url``
will be sent as the ``userid`` section of the SOCKS request::

    proxy_url="socks4a://<userid>@proxy-host"

When connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy the ``username`` and ``password`` portion
of the ``proxy_url`` will be sent as the username/password to authenticate
with the proxy::

    proxy_url="socks5h://<username>:<password>@proxy-host"

requests.packages.urllib3.connectionpoolEmptyProvider._listdir%s is not a subpath of %stag:yaml.org,2002:python/module:ResourceManager.resource_listdirA collection of modules for building different kinds of trees from HTML
documents.

To create a treebuilder for a new type of tree, you need to do
implement several things:

1. A set of classes for various types of elements: Document, Doctype, Comment,
   Element. These must implement the interface of ``base.treebuilders.Node``
   (although comment nodes have a different signature for their constructor,
   see ``treebuilders.etree.Comment``) Textual content may also be implemented
   as another node type, or not, as your tree implementation requires.

2. A treebuilder object (called ``TreeBuilder`` by convention) that inherits
   from ``treebuilders.base.TreeBuilder``. This has 4 required attributes:

   * ``documentClass`` - the class to use for the bottommost node of a document
   * ``elementClass`` - the class to use for HTML Elements
   * ``commentClass`` - the class to use for comments
   * ``doctypeClass`` - the class to use for doctypes

   It also has one required method:

   * ``getDocument`` - Returns the root node of the complete document tree

3. If you wish to run the unit tests, you must also create a ``testSerializer``
   method on your treebuilder which accepts a node and returns a string
   containing Node and its children serialized according to the format used in
   the unittests

Prepares the given HTTP cookie data.

        This function eventually generates a ``Cookie`` header from the
        given cookies using cookielib. Due to cookielib's design, the header
        will not be regenerated if it already exists, meaning this function
        can only be called once for the life of the
        :class:`PreparedRequest <PreparedRequest>` object. Any subsequent calls
        to ``prepare_cookies`` will have no actual effect, unless the "Cookie"
        header is removed beforehand.

SSL with SNI_-support for Python 2. Follow these instructions if you would
like to verify SSL certificates in Python 2. Note, the default libraries do
*not* do certificate checking; you need to do additional work to validate
certificates yourself.

This needs the following packages installed:

* pyOpenSSL (tested with 16.0.0)
* cryptography (minimum 1.3.4, from pyopenssl)
* idna (minimum 2.0, from cryptography)

However, pyopenssl depends on cryptography, which depends on idna, so while we
use all three directly here we end up having relatively few packages required.

You can install them with the following command:

    pip install pyopenssl cryptography idna

To activate certificate checking, call
:func:`~urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3` from your Python code
before you begin making HTTP requests. This can be done in a ``sitecustomize``
module, or at any other time before your application begins using ``urllib3``,
like this::

    try:
        import urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl
        urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()
    except ImportError:
        pass

Now you can use :mod:`urllib3` as you normally would, and it will support SNI
when the required modules are installed.

Activating this module also has the positive side effect of disabling SSL/TLS
compression in Python 2 (see `CRIME attack`_).

If you want to configure the default list of supported cipher suites, you can
set the ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.DEFAULT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST`` variable.

   consistent view of the parsed string, the parse location, and line and column

        Similar to :meth:`httplib.HTTPResponse.read`, but with two additional
        parameters: ``decode_content`` and ``cache_content``.

        :param amt:
            How much of the content to read. If specified, caching is skipped
            because it doesn't make sense to cache partial content as the full
            response.

        :param decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.

        :param cache_content:
            If True, will save the returned data such that the same result is
            returned despite of the state of the underlying file object. This
            is useful if you want the ``.data`` property to continue working
            after having ``.read()`` the file object. (Overridden if ``amt`` is
            set.)

    Defined with string containing all disallowed characters, and an optional

    minimum value < 1 is not valid); the default values for C{max} and C{exact}
    are 0, meaning no maximum or exact length restriction.

    Token for matching strings that are delimited by quoting characters.
    
    Defined with the following parameters:
        - quoteChar - string of one or more characters defining the quote delimiting string
        - escChar - character to escape quotes, typically backslash (default=C{None})
        - escQuote - special quote sequence to escape an embedded quote string (such as SQL's "" to escape an embedded ") (default=C{None})
        - multiline - boolean indicating whether quotes can span multiple lines (default=C{False})
        - unquoteResults - boolean indicating whether the matched text should be unquoted (default=C{True})
        - endQuoteChar - string of one or more characters defining the end of the quote delimited string (default=C{None} => same as quoteChar)
        - convertWhitespaceEscapes - convert escaped whitespace (C{'\t'}, C{'\n'}, etc.) to actual whitespace (default=C{True})

    Example::
        qs = QuotedString('"')
        print(qs.searchString('lsjdf "This is the quote" sldjf'))
        complex_qs = QuotedString('{{', endQuoteChar='}}')
        print(complex_qs.searchString('lsjdf {{This is the "quote"}} sldjf'))
        sql_qs = QuotedString('"', escQuote='""')
        print(sql_qs.searchString('lsjdf "This is the quote with ""embedded"" quotes" sldjf'))
    prints::

        Getter method to remove any trailing dots that indicate the hostname is an FQDN.

        In general, SSL certificates don't include the trailing dot indicating a
        fully-qualified domain name, and thus, they don't validate properly when
        checked against a domain name that includes the dot. In addition, some
        servers may not expect to receive the trailing dot when provided.

        However, the hostname with trailing dot is critical to DNS resolution; doing a
        lookup with the trailing dot will properly only resolve the appropriate FQDN,
        whereas a lookup without a trailing dot will search the system's search domain
        list. Thus, it's important to keep the original host around for use only in
        those cases where it's appropriate (i.e., when doing DNS lookup to establish the
        actual TCP connection across which we're going to send HTTP requests).

        :param amt:
            How much of the content to read. If specified, caching is skipped
            because it doesn't make sense to cache partial content as the full
            response.

        :param decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.

    Forward declaration of an expression to be defined later -
    used for recursive grammars, such as algebraic infix notation.
    When the expression is known, it is assigned to the C{Forward} variable using the '<<' operator.

    Note: take care when assigning to C{Forward} not to overlook precedence of operators.
    Specifically, '|' has a lower precedence than '<<', so that::
        fwdExpr << a | b | c
    will actually be evaluated as::
        (fwdExpr << a) | b | c
    thereby leaving b and c out as parseable alternatives.  It is recommended that you
    explicitly group the values inserted into the C{Forward}::
        fwdExpr << (a | b | c)
    Converting to use the '<<=' operator instead will avoid this problem.

    See L{ParseResults.pprint} for an example of a recursive parser created using
    C{Forward}.

        Make a request using :meth:`urlopen` with the appropriate encoding of
        ``fields`` based on the ``method`` used.

        This is a convenience method that requires the least amount of manual
        effort. It can be used in most situations, while still having the
        option to drop down to more specific methods when necessary, such as
        :meth:`request_encode_url`, :meth:`request_encode_body`,
        or even the lowest level :meth:`urlopen`.
        Enables "packrat" parsing, which adds memoizing to the parsing logic.
           Repeated parse attempts at the same string location (which happens
           often in many complex grammars) can immediately return a cached value,
           instead of re-executing parsing/validating code.  Memoizing is done of
           both valid results and parsing exceptions.
           
           Parameters:
            - cache_size_limit - (default=C{128}) - if an integer value is provided
              will limit the size of the packrat cache; if None is passed, then
              the cache size will be unbounded; if 0 is passed, the cache will
              be effectively disabled.
            
           This speedup may break existing programs that use parse actions that
           have side-effects.  For this reason, packrat parsing is disabled when
           you first import pyparsing.  To activate the packrat feature, your
           program must call the class method C{ParserElement.enablePackrat()}.  If
           your program uses C{psyco} to "compile as you go", you must call
           C{enablePackrat} before calling C{psyco.full()}.  If you do not do this,
           Python will crash.  For best results, call C{enablePackrat()} immediately
           after importing pyparsing.
           
           Example::
               import pyparsing
               pyparsing.ParserElement.enablePackrat()

    Helper to create a validating parse action to be used with start tags created
    with C{L{makeXMLTags}} or C{L{makeHTMLTags}}. Use C{withAttribute} to qualify a starting tag
    with a required attribute value, to avoid false matches on common tags such as
    C{<TD>} or C{<DIV>}.

    Call C{withAttribute} with a series of attribute names and values. Specify the list
    of filter attributes names and values as:
     - keyword arguments, as in C{(align="right")}, or
     - as an explicit dict with C{**} operator, when an attribute name is also a Python
          reserved word, as in C{**{"class":"Customer", "align":"right"}}
     - a list of name-value tuples, as in ( ("ns1:class", "Customer"), ("ns2:align","right") )
    For attribute names with a namespace prefix, you must use the second form.  Attribute
    names are matched insensitive to upper/lower case.
       
    If just testing for C{class} (with or without a namespace), use C{L{withClass}}.

    To verify that the attribute exists, but without specifying a value, pass
    C{withAttribute.ANY_VALUE} as the value.

        html = '''

Utility method to list all the domains in the jar.return confidence based on existing dataParseResults.dump.<locals>.<genexpr>
requests.utils
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module provides utility functions that are used within Requests
that are also useful for external consumption.

        Make a request using :meth:`urlopen` with the ``fields`` encoded in
        the body. This is useful for request methods like POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.

        When ``encode_multipart=True`` (default), then
        :meth:`urllib3.filepost.encode_multipart_formdata` is used to encode
        the payload with the appropriate content type. Otherwise
        :meth:`urllib.urlencode` is used with the
        'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' content type.

        Multipart encoding must be used when posting files, and it's reasonably
        safe to use it in other times too. However, it may break request
        signing, such as with OAuth.

        Supports an optional ``fields`` parameter of key/value strings AND
        key/filetuple. A filetuple is a (filename, data, MIME type) tuple where
        the MIME type is optional. For example::

            fields = {
                'foo': 'bar',
                'fakefile': ('foofile.txt', 'contents of foofile'),
                'realfile': ('barfile.txt', open('realfile').read()),
                'typedfile': ('bazfile.bin', open('bazfile').read(),
                              'image/jpeg'),
                'nonamefile': 'contents of nonamefile field',
            }

        When uploading a file, providing a filename (the first parameter of the
        tuple) is optional but recommended to best mimic behavior of browsers.

        Note that if ``headers`` are supplied, the 'Content-Type' header will
        be overwritten because it depends on the dynamic random boundary string
        which is used to compose the body of the request. The random boundary
        string can be explicitly set with the ``multipart_boundary`` parameter.
        HTTPConnectionPool._new_connextend() takes at most 1 positional arguments ({0} given)Execute code in a namespace.EUCKRProber.languageInvalid Retry-After header: %sName '%s' is not a valid IDNA label
    Convenience mixin for classes who implement a :meth:`urlopen` method, such
    as :class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool` and
    :class:`~urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager`.

    Provides behavior for making common types of HTTP request methods and
    decides which type of request field encoding to use.

    Specifically,

    :meth:`.request_encode_url` is for sending requests whose fields are
    encoded in the URL (such as GET, HEAD, DELETE).

    :meth:`.request_encode_body` is for sending requests whose fields are
    encoded in the *body* of the request using multipart or www-form-urlencoded
    (such as for POST, PUT, PATCH).

    :meth:`.request` is for making any kind of request, it will look up the
    appropriate encoding format and use one of the above two methods to make
    the request.

    Initializer parameters:

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given
        explicitly.

        Removes and returns item at specified index (default=C{last}).
        Supports both C{list} and C{dict} semantics for C{pop()}. If passed no
        argument or an integer argument, it will use C{list} semantics
        and pop tokens from the list of parsed tokens. If passed a 
        non-integer argument (most likely a string), it will use C{dict}
        semantics and pop the corresponding value from any defined 
        results names. A second default return value argument is 
        supported, just as in C{dict.pop()}.

        Example::
            def remove_first(tokens):
                tokens.pop(0)
            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> ['0', '123', '321']
            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).addParseAction(remove_first).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> ['123', '321']

            label = Word(alphas)
            patt = label("LABEL") + OneOrMore(Word(nums))
            print(patt.parseString("AAB 123 321").dump())

            # Use pop() in a parse action to remove named result (note that corresponding value is not
            # removed from list form of results)
            def remove_LABEL(tokens):
                tokens.pop("LABEL")
                return tokens
            patt.addParseAction(remove_LABEL)
            print(patt.parseString("AAB 123 321").dump())
        prints::
            ['AAB', '123', '321']
            - LABEL: AAB

            ['AAB', '123', '321']
        
Package resource API
--------------------

A resource is a logical file contained within a package, or a logical
subdirectory thereof.  The package resource API expects resource names
to have their path parts separated with ``/``, *not* whatever the local
path separator is.  Do not use os.path operations to manipulate resource
names being passed into the API.

The package resource API is designed to work with normal filesystem packages,
.egg files, and unpacked .egg files.  It can also work in a limited way with
.zip files and with custom PEP 302 loaders that support the ``get_data()``
method.

Requests HTTP Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requests is an HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings. Basic GET
usage:

   >>> import requests
   >>> r = requests.get('https://www.python.org')
   >>> r.status_code
   200
   >>> 'Python is a programming language' in r.content
   True

... or POST:

   >>> payload = dict(key1='value1', key2='value2')
   >>> r = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload)
   >>> print(r.text)
   {
     ...
     "form": {
       "key2": "value2",
       "key1": "value1"
     },
     ...
   }

The other HTTP methods are supported - see `requests.api`. Full documentation
is at <http://python-requests.org>.

        Execute the parse expression on a series of test strings, showing each
        test, the parsed results or where the parse failed. Quick and easy way to
        run a parse expression against a list of sample strings.
           
        Parameters:
         - tests - a list of separate test strings, or a multiline string of test strings
         - parseAll - (default=C{True}) - flag to pass to C{L{parseString}} when running tests           
         - comment - (default=C{'#'}) - expression for indicating embedded comments in the test 
              string; pass None to disable comment filtering
         - fullDump - (default=C{True}) - dump results as list followed by results names in nested outline;
              if False, only dump nested list
         - printResults - (default=C{True}) prints test output to stdout
         - failureTests - (default=C{False}) indicates if these tests are expected to fail parsing

        Returns: a (success, results) tuple, where success indicates that all tests succeeded
        (or failed if C{failureTests} is True), and the results contain a list of lines of each 
        test's output
        
        Example::
            number_expr = pyparsing_common.number.copy()

            result = number_expr.runTests('''

        Each test string must be on a single line. If you want to test a string that spans multiple
        lines, create a test like this::

            expr.runTest(r"this is a test\n of strings that spans \n 3 lines")
        
        (Note that this is a raw string literal, you must include the leading 'r'.)

    Helper to define a delimited list of expressions - the delimiter defaults to ','.
    By default, the list elements and delimiters can have intervening whitespace, and

    AuthBase.__call__Split a string or iterable thereof into (section, content) pairs

        Does the package contain the named resource? Retry configuration.

    Each retry attempt will create a new Retry object with updated values, so
    they can be safely reused.

    Retries can be defined as a default for a pool::

        retries = Retry(connect=5, read=2, redirect=5)
        http = PoolManager(retries=retries)
        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/')

    Or per-request (which overrides the default for the pool)::

        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/', retries=Retry(10))

    Retries can be disabled by passing ``False``::

        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/', retries=False)

    Errors will be wrapped in :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` unless
    retries are disabled, in which case the causing exception will be raised.

    :param int total:
        Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.

        Set to ``None`` to remove this constraint and fall back on other
        counts. It's a good idea to set this to some sensibly-high value to
        account for unexpected edge cases and avoid infinite retry loops.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry.

        Set to ``False`` to disable and imply ``raise_on_redirect=False``.

    :param int connect:
        How many connection-related errors to retry on.

        These are errors raised before the request is sent to the remote server,
        which we assume has not triggered the server to process the request.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

    :param int read:
        How many times to retry on read errors.

        These errors are raised after the request was sent to the server, so the
        request may have side-effects.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

    :param int redirect:
        How many redirects to perform. Limit this to avoid infinite redirect
        loops.

        A redirect is a HTTP response with a status code 301, 302, 303, 307 or
        308.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

        Set to ``False`` to disable and imply ``raise_on_redirect=False``.

    :param int status:
        How many times to retry on bad status codes.

        These are retries made on responses, where status code matches
        ``status_forcelist``.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

    :param iterable method_whitelist:
        Set of uppercased HTTP method verbs that we should retry on.

        By default, we only retry on methods which are considered to be
        idempotent (multiple requests with the same parameters end with the
        same state). See :attr:`Retry.DEFAULT_METHOD_WHITELIST`.

        Set to a ``False`` value to retry on any verb.

    :param iterable status_forcelist:
        A set of integer HTTP status codes that we should force a retry on.
        A retry is initiated if the request method is in ``method_whitelist``
        and the response status code is in ``status_forcelist``.

        By default, this is disabled with ``None``.

    :param float backoff_factor:
        A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try
        (most errors are resolved immediately by a second try without a
        delay). urllib3 will sleep for::

            {backoff factor} * (2 ** ({number of total retries} - 1))

        seconds. If the backoff_factor is 0.1, then :func:`.sleep` will sleep
        for [0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries. It will never be longer
        than :attr:`Retry.BACKOFF_MAX`.

        By default, backoff is disabled (set to 0).

    :param bool raise_on_redirect: Whether, if the number of redirects is
        exhausted, to raise a MaxRetryError, or to return a response with a
        response code in the 3xx range.

    :param bool raise_on_status: Similar meaning to ``raise_on_redirect``:
        whether we should raise an exception, or return a response,
        if status falls in ``status_forcelist`` range and retries have
        been exhausted.

    :param tuple history: The history of the request encountered during
        each call to :meth:`~Retry.increment`. The list is in the order
        the requests occurred. Each list item is of class :class:`RequestHistory`.

    :param bool respect_retry_after_header:
        Whether to respect Retry-After header on status codes defined as
        :attr:`Retry.RETRY_AFTER_STATUS_CODES` or not.

    :param iterable remove_headers_on_redirect:
        Sequence of headers to remove from the request when a response
        indicating a redirect is returned before firing off the redirected
        request.
    namespace_packages.txtReturn absolute location in cache for `archive_name` and `names`

        The parent directory of the resulting path will be created if it does
        not already exist.  `archive_name` should be the base filename of the
        enclosing egg (which may not be the name of the enclosing zipfile!),
        including its ".egg" extension.  `names`, if provided, should be a
        sequence of path name parts "under" the egg's extraction location.

        This method should only be called by resource providers that need to
        obtain an extraction location, and only for names they intend to
        extract, as it tracks the generated names for possible cleanup later.
        ParseResults.asXML>!<Find all activatable distributions in `plugin_env`

        Example usage::

            distributions, errors = working_set.find_plugins(
                Environment(plugin_dirlist)
            )
            # add plugins+libs to sys.path
            map(working_set.add, distributions)
            # display errors
            print('Could not load', errors)

        The `plugin_env` should be an ``Environment`` instance that contains
        only distributions that are in the project's "plugin directory" or
        directories. The `full_env`, if supplied, should be an ``Environment``
        contains all currently-available distributions.  If `full_env` is not
        supplied, one is created automatically from the ``WorkingSet`` this
        method is called on, which will typically mean that every directory on
        ``sys.path`` will be scanned for distributions.

        `installer` is a standard installer callback as used by the
        ``resolve()`` method. The `fallback` flag indicates whether we should
        attempt to resolve older versions of a plugin if the newest version
        cannot be resolved.

        This method returns a 2-tuple: (`distributions`, `error_info`), where
        `distributions` is a list of the distributions found in `plugin_env`
        that were loadable, along with any other distributions that are needed
        to resolve their dependencies.  `error_info` is a dictionary mapping
        unloadable plugin distributions to an exception instance describing the
        error that occurred. Usually this will be a ``DistributionNotFound`` or
        ``VersionConflict`` instance.

This module handles import compatibility issues between Python 2 and
Python 3.
Return full path to the user-specific log dir for this application.

        "appname" is the name of application.
            If None, just the system directory is returned.
        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the
            appauthor or distributing body for this application. Typically
            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may
            pass False to disable it.
        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the
            path. You might want to use this if you want multiple versions
            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "opinion" (boolean) can be False to disable the appending of
            "Logs" to the base app data dir for Windows, and "log" to the
            base cache dir for Unix. See discussion below.

    Typical user log directories are:
        Mac OS X:   ~/Library/Logs/<AppName>
        Unix:       ~/.cache/<AppName>/log  # or under $XDG_CACHE_HOME if defined
        Win XP:     C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Logs
        Vista:      C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Logs

    On Windows the only suggestion in the MSDN docs is that local settings
    go in the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` directory. (Note: I'm interested in
    examples of what some windows apps use for a logs dir.)

    OPINION: This function appends "Logs" to the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA`
    value for Windows and appends "log" to the user cache dir for Unix.
    This can be disabled with the `opinion=False` option.

    Helper method for defining parse actions that require matching at a specific
    column in the input text.
    Raised by assert_header_parsing, but we convert it to a log.warning statement.
    Token to exactly match a specified string.
    
    Example::
        Literal('blah').parseString('blah')  # -> ['blah']
        Literal('blah').parseString('blahfooblah')  # -> ['blah']
        Literal('blah').parseString('bla')  # -> Exception: Expected "blah"
    
    For case-insensitive matching, use L{CaselessLiteral}.
    
    For keyword matching (force word break before and after the matched string),
    use L{Keyword} or L{CaselessKeyword}.
    Trie.__getitem__ResourceManager.resource_string
        Implementation of + operator - returns C{L{And}}. Adding strings to a ParserElement
        converts them to L{Literal}s by default.
        
        Example::
            greet = Word(alphas) + "," + Word(alphas) + "!"
            hello = "Hello, World!"
            print (hello, "->", greet.parseString(hello))
        Prints::
            Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']
        Coerce **s** to six.binary_type.

    For Python 2:
      - `unicode` -> encoded to `str`
      - `str` -> `str`

    For Python 3:
      - `str` -> encoded to `bytes`
      - `bytes` -> `bytes`
    Returns the json-encoded content of a response, if any.

    Response.linksHTTPConnection.request_chunked
        Convert self into a url

        This function should more or less round-trip with :func:`.parse_url`. The
        returned url may not be exactly the same as the url inputted to
        :func:`.parse_url`, but it should be equivalent by the RFC (e.g., urls
        with a blank port will have : removed).

        Example: ::

            >>> U = parse_url('http://google.com/mail/')
            >>> U.url
            'http://google.com/mail/'
            >>> Url('http', 'username:password', 'host.com', 80,
            ... '/path', 'query', 'fragment').url
            'http://username:password@host.com:80/path?query#fragment'
        Removed sequence creation for unused sequence.
    Wrapper for parse actions, to ensure they are only called once.
    NegativeInfinity.__ne__
    Repetition of one or more of the given expression.
    
    Parameters:
     - expr - expression that must match one or more times
     - stopOn - (default=C{None}) - expression for a terminating sentinel
          (only required if the sentinel would ordinarily match the repetition 
          expression)          

    Example::
        data_word = Word(alphas)
        label = data_word + FollowedBy(':')
        attr_expr = Group(label + Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word).setParseAction(' '.join))

        text = "shape: SQUARE posn: upper left color: BLACK"
        OneOrMore(attr_expr).parseString(text).pprint()  # Fail! read 'color' as data instead of next label -> [['shape', 'SQUARE color']]

        # use stopOn attribute for OneOrMore to avoid reading label string as part of the data
        attr_expr = Group(label + Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word, stopOn=label).setParseAction(' '.join))
        OneOrMore(attr_expr).parseString(text).pprint() # Better -> [['shape', 'SQUARE'], ['posn', 'upper left'], ['color', 'BLACK']]

            print(table_text.parseString(text).body) # -> 'More info at the pyparsing wiki page'
        OrderedSet.addReturn full path to the user-specific config dir for this application.

        "appname" is the name of application.
            If None, just the system directory is returned.
        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the
            appauthor or distributing body for this application. Typically
            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may
            pass False to disable it.

            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "roaming" (boolean, default False) can be set True to use the Windows
            roaming appdata directory. That means that for users on a Windows
            network setup for roaming profiles, this user data will be
            sync'd on login. See
            <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766489(WS.10).aspx>
            for a discussion of issues.

    Typical user config directories are:
        Mac OS X:               same as user_data_dir
        Unix:                   ~/.config/<AppName>     # or in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, if defined
        Win *:                  same as user_data_dir

    For Unix, we follow the XDG spec and support $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
    That means, by default "~/.config/<AppName>".

        If you do not call this routine before any extractions take place, the
        path defaults to the return value of ``get_default_cache()``.  (Which
        is based on the ``PYTHON_EGG_CACHE`` environment variable, with various
        platform-specific fallbacks.  See that routine's documentation for more
        details.)

        Resources are extracted to subdirectories of this path based upon
        information given by the ``IResourceProvider``.  You may set this to a
        temporary directory, but then you must call ``cleanup_resources()`` to
        delete the extracted files when done.  There is no guarantee that
        ``cleanup_resources()`` will be able to remove all extracted files.

        (Note: you may not change the extraction path for a given resource
        manager once resources have been extracted, unless you first call
        ``cleanup_resources()``.)

    Connection manager for Google App Engine sandbox applications.

    This manager uses the URLFetch service directly instead of using the

    the App Engine documentation `here
    <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch>`_.

    Notably it will raise an :class:`AppEnginePlatformError` if:
        * URLFetch is not available.
        * If you attempt to use this on App Engine Flexible, as full socket
          support is available.
        * If a request size is more than 10 megabytes.
        * If a response size is more than 32 megabtyes.
        * If you use an unsupported request method such as OPTIONS.

    Beyond those cases, it will raise normal urllib3 errors.

        "appname" is the name of application.
            If None, just the system directory is returned.
        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the
            appauthor or distributing body for this application. Typically
            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may
            pass False to disable it.
        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the

            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "multipath" is an optional parameter only applicable to *nix
            which indicates that the entire list of data dirs should be

            returned, or '/usr/local/share/<AppName>',
            if XDG_DATA_DIRS is not set

    Typical site data directories are:
        Mac OS X:   /Library/Application Support/<AppName>
        Unix:       /usr/local/share/<AppName> or /usr/share/<AppName>

    Token for matching strings that match a given regular expression.
    Defined with string specifying the regular expression in a form recognized by the inbuilt Python re module.
    If the given regex contains named groups (defined using C{(?P<name>...)}), these will be preserved as 
    named parse results.

    Example::
        realnum = Regex(r"[+-]?\d+\.\d*")
        date = Regex(r'(?P<year>\d{4})-(?P<month>\d\d?)-(?P<day>\d\d?)')

        the status code is between 200 and 400, this will return True. This
        is **not** a check to see if the response code is ``200 OK``.

    This function creates a temporary Mac keychain that we can use to work with
    credentials. This keychain uses a one-time password and a temporary file to
    store the data. We expect to have one keychain per socket. The returned
    SecKeychainRef must be freed by the caller, including calling
    SecKeychainDelete.

    Returns a tuple of the SecKeychainRef and the path to the temporary
    directory that contains it.
    Iterates over the response data.  When stream=True is set on the
        request, this avoids reading the content at once into memory for
        large responses.  The chunk size is the number of bytes it should
        read into memory.  This is not necessarily the length of each item
        returned as decoding can take place.

        chunk_size must be of type int or None. A value of None will
        function differently depending on the value of `stream`.
        stream=True will read data as it arrives in whatever size the
        chunks are received. If stream=False, data is returned as
        a single chunk.

        If decode_unicode is True, content will be decoded using the best
        available encoding based on the response.
        Return the `name` entry point of `group` or raise ImportErrorNotAny.__init__

            print(type(result_dict), repr(result_dict)) # -> <class 'dict'> {'day': '1999', 'year': '12', 'month': '31'}

         Create a new Timeout from a legacy timeout value.

        The timeout value used by httplib.py sets the same timeout on the
        connect(), and recv() socket requests. This creates a :class:`Timeout`
        object that sets the individual timeouts to the ``timeout`` value
        passed to this function.

        :param timeout: The legacy timeout value.
        :type timeout: integer, float, sentinel default object, or None

        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the

            "Cache" to the base app data dir for Windows. See

    Typical user cache directories are:
        Mac OS X:   ~/Library/Caches/<AppName>
        Unix:       ~/.cache/<AppName> (XDG default)
        Win XP:     C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Cache
        Vista:      C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Cache

    On Windows the only suggestion in the MSDN docs is that local settings go in
    the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` directory. This is identical to the non-roaming
    app data dir (the default returned by `user_data_dir` above). Apps typically
    put cache data somewhere *under* the given dir here. Some examples:
        ...\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<ProfileName>\Cache
        ...\Acme\SuperApp\Cache\1.0
    OPINION: This function appends "Cache" to the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` value.
    This can be disabled with the `opinion=False` option.
    WrappedSocket._set_ciphersillegal nestingZipProvider._eager_to_zipSpecifierSet.__hash__You can only send PreparedRequests.Register `namespace_handler` to declare namespace packages

    `importer_type` is the type or class of a PEP 302 "Importer" (sys.path item

        def namespace_handler(importer, path_entry, moduleName, module):
            # return a path_entry to use for child packages

    Namespace handlers are only called if the importer object has already
    agreed that it can handle the relevant path item, and they should only
    return a subpath if the module __path__ does not already contain an
    equivalent subpath.  For an example namespace handler, see
    ``pkg_resources.file_ns_handler``.

    A state machine to verify a byte sequence for a particular encoding. For
    each byte the detector receives, it will feed that byte to every active
    state machine available, one byte at a time. The state machine changes its
    state based on its previous state and the byte it receives. There are 3
    states in a state machine that are of interest to an auto-detector:

    START state: This is the state to start with, or a legal byte sequence
                 (i.e. a valid code point) for character has been identified.

    ME state:  This indicates that the state machine identified a byte sequence
               that is specific to the charset it is designed for and that
               there is no other possible encoding which can contain this byte
               sequence. This will to lead to an immediate positive answer for
               the detector.

    ERROR state: This indicates the state machine identified an illegal byte
                 sequence for that encoding. This will lead to an immediate
                 negative answer for this encoding. Detector will exclude this

    HTTP Response container.

    Backwards-compatible to httplib's HTTPResponse but the response ``body`` is
    loaded and decoded on-demand when the ``data`` property is accessed.  This
    class is also compatible with the Python standard library's :mod:`io`

        Define name for referencing matching tokens as a nested attribute
        of the returned parse results.
        NOTE: this returns a *copy* of the original C{ParserElement} object;
        this is so that the client can define a basic element, such as an
        integer, and reference it in multiple places with different names.

        You can also set results names using the abbreviated syntax,
        C{expr("name")} in place of C{expr.setResultsName("name")} - 
        see L{I{__call__}<__call__>}.

        Snapshot distributions available on a search path

        Any distributions found on `search_path` are added to the environment.
        `search_path` should be a sequence of ``sys.path`` items.  If not
        supplied, ``sys.path`` is used.

        `platform` is an optional string specifying the name of the platform
        that platform-specific distributions must be compatible with.  If
        unspecified, it defaults to the current platform.  `python` is an
        optional string naming the desired version of Python (e.g. ``'3.6'``);
        it defaults to the current version.

        You may explicitly set `platform` (and/or `python`) to ``None`` if you
        wish to map *all* distributions, not just those compatible with the
        running platform or Python version.

    Timeouts can be defined as a default for a pool::

        timeout = Timeout(connect=2.0, read=7.0)
        http = PoolManager(timeout=timeout)
        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/')

    Or per-request (which overrides the default for the pool)::

        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/', timeout=Timeout(10))

    Timeouts can be disabled by setting all the parameters to ``None``::

        no_timeout = Timeout(connect=None, read=None)
        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/, timeout=no_timeout)


    :param total:
        This combines the connect and read timeouts into one; the read timeout
        will be set to the time leftover from the connect attempt. In the
        event that both a connect timeout and a total are specified, or a read
        timeout and a total are specified, the shorter timeout will be applied.

        Defaults to None.

    :type total: integer, float, or None

    :param connect:
        The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a connection
        attempt to a server to succeed. Omitting the parameter will default the
        connect timeout to the system default, probably `the global default
        timeout in socket.py
        <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/603b4d593758/Lib/socket.py#l535>`_.
        None will set an infinite timeout for connection attempts.

    :type connect: integer, float, or None

    :param read:
        The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait between consecutive
        read operations for a response from the server. Omitting the parameter
        will default the read timeout to the system default, probably `the
        global default timeout in socket.py
        <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/603b4d593758/Lib/socket.py#l535>`_.
        None will set an infinite timeout.

    :type read: integer, float, or None

    .. note::

        Many factors can affect the total amount of time for urllib3 to return
        an HTTP response.

        For example, Python's DNS resolver does not obey the timeout specified
        on the socket. Other factors that can affect total request time include
        high CPU load, high swap, the program running at a low priority level,
        or other behaviors.

        In addition, the read and total timeouts only measure the time between
        read operations on the socket connecting the client and the server,
        not the total amount of time for the request to return a complete
        response. For most requests, the timeout is raised because the server
        has not sent the first byte in the specified time. This is not always
        the case; if a server streams one byte every fifteen seconds, a timeout
        of 20 seconds will not trigger, even though the request will take
        several minutes to complete.

        If your goal is to cut off any request after a set amount of wall clock
        time, consider having a second "watcher" thread to cut off a slow
        request.

    Accepted parameters include:

            HTTPConnection.default_socket_options + [
                (socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_KEEPALIVE, 1),

    Helper to define a counted list of expressions.
    This helper defines a pattern of the form::

    The matched tokens returns the array of expr tokens as a list - the leading count token is suppressed.
    
    If C{intExpr} is specified, it should be a pyparsing expression that produces an integer value.

        # in this parser, the leading integer value is given in binary,

    Helper to define an expression that is indirectly defined from

        first = Word(nums)
        second = matchPreviousExpr(first)
        matchExpr = first + ":" + second
    will match C{"1:1"}, but not C{"1:2"}.  Because this matches by
    expressions, will I{not} match the leading C{"1:1"} in C{"1:10"};
    the expressions are evaluated first, and then compared, so

        A :class:`~urllib3.fields.RequestField` factory from old-style tuple parameters.

        Supports constructing :class:`~urllib3.fields.RequestField` from
        parameter of key/value strings AND key/filetuple. A filetuple is a
        (filename, data, MIME type) tuple where the MIME type is optional.
        For example::

            'foo': 'bar',
            'fakefile': ('foofile.txt', 'contents of foofile'),
            'realfile': ('barfile.txt', open('realfile').read()),
            'typedfile': ('bazfile.bin', open('bazfile').read(), 'image/jpeg'),

        Field names and filenames must be unicode.
        Module %s was already imported from %s, but %s is being added to sys.pathParse lists as described by RFC 2068 Section 2.

    In particular, parse comma-separated lists where the elements of
    the list may include quoted-strings.  A quoted-string could
    contain a comma.  A non-quoted string could have quotes in the
    middle.  Quotes are removed automatically after parsing.

    It basically works like :func:`parse_set_header` just that items
    may appear multiple times and case sensitivity is preserved.

    The return value is a standard :class:`list`:

    >>> parse_list_header('token, "quoted value"')
    ['token', 'quoted value']

    To create a header from the :class:`list` again, use the

    Converts a dNSName SubjectAlternativeName field to the form used by the

    Cryptography produces a dNSName as a unicode string that was idna-decoded
    from ASCII bytes. We need to idna-encode that string to get it back, and
    then on Python 3 we also need to convert to unicode via UTF-8 (the stdlib
    uses PyUnicode_FromStringAndSize on it, which decodes via UTF-8).

    If the name cannot be idna-encoded then we return None signalling that
    the name given should be skipped.

    Helper to easily and clearly define a dictionary by specifying the respective patterns
    for the key and value.  Takes care of defining the C{L{Dict}}, C{L{ZeroOrMore}}, and C{L{Group}} tokens
    in the proper order.  The key pattern can include delimiting markers or punctuation,
    as long as they are suppressed, thereby leaving the significant key text.  The value
    pattern can include named results, so that the C{Dict} results can include named token
    fields.

    Example::
        text = "shape: SQUARE posn: upper left color: light blue texture: burlap"
        attr_expr = (label + Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word, stopOn=label).setParseAction(' '.join))
        print(OneOrMore(attr_expr).parseString(text).dump())
        
        attr_label = label
        attr_value = Suppress(':') + OneOrMore(data_word, stopOn=label).setParseAction(' '.join)

        # similar to Dict, but simpler call format
        result = dictOf(attr_label, attr_value).parseString(text)
        print(result.dump())
        print(result['shape'])
        print(result.shape)  # object attribute access works too

pyparsing module - Classes and methods to define and execute parsing grammars
=============================================================================

The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and executing simple grammars,
vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the use of regular expressions.  With pyparsing, you
don't need to learn a new syntax for defining grammars or matching expressions - the parsing module
provides a library of classes that you use to construct the grammar directly in Python.

Here is a program to parse "Hello, World!" (or any greeting of the form 
C{"<salutation>, <addressee>!"}), built up using L{Word}, L{Literal}, and L{And} elements 
(L{'+'<ParserElement.__add__>} operator gives L{And} expressions, strings are auto-converted to
L{Literal} expressions)::

    from pyparsing import Word, alphas

    # define grammar of a greeting
    greet = Word(alphas) + "," + Word(alphas) + "!"

    hello = "Hello, World!"
    print (hello, "->", greet.parseString(hello))

The program outputs the following::

    Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']

The Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the self-explanatory
class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' operators.

The L{ParseResults} object returned from L{ParserElement.parseString<ParserElement.parseString>} can be accessed as a nested list, a dictionary, or an
object with named attributes.

The pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically vexing when writing text parsers:
 - extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle "Hello,World!", "Hello  ,  World  !", etc.)
 - quoted strings
 - embedded comments


Getting Started -
-----------------
Visit the classes L{ParserElement} and L{ParseResults} to see the base classes that most other pyparsing
classes inherit from. Use the docstrings for examples of how to:
 - construct literal match expressions from L{Literal} and L{CaselessLiteral} classes
 - construct character word-group expressions using the L{Word} class
 - see how to create repetitive expressions using L{ZeroOrMore} and L{OneOrMore} classes
 - use L{'+'<And>}, L{'|'<MatchFirst>}, L{'^'<Or>}, and L{'&'<Each>} operators to combine simple expressions into more complex ones
 - associate names with your parsed results using L{ParserElement.setResultsName}
 - find some helpful expression short-cuts like L{delimitedList} and L{oneOf}
 - find more useful common expressions in the L{pyparsing_common} namespace class

        "appname" is the name of application.

        "appauthor" (only used on Windows) is the name of the
            appauthor or distributing body for this application. Typically
            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may
            pass False to disable it.
        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the
            path. You might want to use this if you want multiple versions
            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "roaming" (boolean, default False) can be set True to use the Windows
            roaming appdata directory. That means that for users on a Windows

    Typical user data directories are:
        Mac OS X:               ~/Library/Application Support/<AppName>
        Unix:                   ~/.local/share/<AppName>    # or in $XDG_DATA_HOME, if defined
        Win XP (not roaming):   C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>
        Win XP (roaming):       C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Application Data\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>
        Win 7  (not roaming):   C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>
        Win 7  (roaming):       C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>

    For Unix, we follow the XDG spec and support $XDG_DATA_HOME.
    That means, by default "~/.local/share/<AppName>".

    Requests does not use the dict interface internally; it's just for

    out of the box with externally provided instances of ``CookieJar``, e.g.
    ``LWPCookieJar`` and ``FileCookieJar``.

but are necessary to get them to work. They include a whole bunch of low-level
CoreFoundation messing about and memory management. The concerns in this module
are almost entirely about trying to avoid memory leaks and providing
appropriate and useful assistance to the higher-level code.
RequestsCookieJar.copySecureTransport doesn't support custom cipher strings
        Checks if the underlying file-like object looks like a
        httplib.HTTPResponse object. We do this by testing for the fp
        attribute. If it is present we assume it returns raw chunks as
        processed by read_chunked().

        Returns named result matching the given key, or if there is no

        Similar to C{dict.get()}.
        
        Example::

    LegacySpecifier._compare_less_than_equalTag.platformObtain the url to use when making the final request.

        If the message is being sent through a HTTP proxy, the full URL has to
        be used. Otherwise, we should only use the path portion of the URL.

        This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed for use
        when subclassing the
        :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        :param request: The :class:`PreparedRequest <PreparedRequest>` being sent.
        :param proxies: A dictionary of schemes or schemes and hosts to proxy URLs.

    :param headers:
        An iterable of field-value pairs. Must not contain multiple field names
        when compared case-insensitively.

    :param kwargs:
        Additional field-value pairs to pass in to ``dict.update``.

    A ``dict`` like container for storing HTTP Headers.

    Field names are stored and compared case-insensitively in compliance with
    RFC 7230. Iteration provides the first case-sensitive key seen for each
    case-insensitive pair.

    Using ``__setitem__`` syntax overwrites fields that compare equal
    case-insensitively in order to maintain ``dict``'s api. For fields that
    compare equal, instead create a new ``HTTPHeaderDict`` and use ``.add``
    in a loop.

    If multiple fields that are equal case-insensitively are passed to the
    constructor or ``.update``, the behavior is undefined and some will be
    lost.

    >>> headers.add('Set-Cookie', 'foo=bar')

        EUCKRDistributionAnalysis.get_order
    Helper method for defining nested lists enclosed in opening and closing
    delimiters ("(" and ")" are the default).

    Parameters:
     - opener - opening character for a nested list (default=C{"("}); can also be a pyparsing expression
     - closer - closing character for a nested list (default=C{")"}); can also be a pyparsing expression
     - content - expression for items within the nested lists (default=C{None})
     - ignoreExpr - expression for ignoring opening and closing delimiters (default=C{quotedString})

    If an expression is not provided for the content argument, the nested
    expression will capture all whitespace-delimited content between delimiters
    as a list of separate values.

    Use the C{ignoreExpr} argument to define expressions that may contain
    opening or closing characters that should not be treated as opening
    or closing characters for nesting, such as quotedString or a comment
    expression.  Specify multiple expressions using an C{L{Or}} or C{L{MatchFirst}}.
    The default is L{quotedString}, but if no expressions are to be ignored,
    then pass C{None} for this argument.

    Example::
        data_type = oneOf("void int short long char float double")
        decl_data_type = Combine(data_type + Optional(Word('*')))
        ident = Word(alphas+'_', alphanums+'_')
        number = pyparsing_common.number
        arg = Group(decl_data_type + ident)

    Token for skipping over all undefined text until the matched expression is found.

    Parameters:
     - expr - target expression marking the end of the data to be skipped
     - include - (default=C{False}) if True, the target expression is also parsed 
          (the skipped text and target expression are returned as a 2-element list).
     - ignore - (default=C{None}) used to define grammars (typically quoted strings and 
          comments) that might contain false matches to the target expression
     - failOn - (default=C{None}) define expressions that are not allowed to be 
          included in the skipped test; if found before the target expression is found, 
          the SkipTo is not a match

HTML parsing library based on the `WHATWG HTML specification
<https://whatwg.org/html>`_. The parser is designed to be compatible with
existing HTML found in the wild and implements well-defined error recovery that
is largely compatible with modern desktop web browsers.

Example usage::

    from pip._vendor import html5lib
    with open("my_document.html", "rb") as f:
        tree = html5lib.parse(f)

For convenience, this module re-exports the following names:

* :func:`~.html5parser.parse`
* :func:`~.html5parser.parseFragment`
* :class:`~.html5parser.HTMLParser`
* :func:`~.treebuilders.getTreeBuilder`
* :func:`~.treewalkers.getTreeWalker`
* :func:`~.serializer.serialize`

    Decorator for debugging parse actions. 
    
    When the parse action is called, this decorator will print C{">> entering I{method-name}(line:I{current_source_line}, I{parse_location}, I{matched_tokens})".}
    When the parse action completes, the decorator will print C{"<<"} followed by the returned value, or any exception that the parse action raised.

        Method for quick testing of a parser against a test string. Good for simple 
        inline microtests of sub expressions while building up larger parser.
           
        Parameters:
         - testString - to test against this expression for a match
         - parseAll - (default=C{True}) - flag to pass to C{L{parseString}} when running tests
            
        Example::
            expr = Word(nums)
            assert expr.matches("100")
        /Users/francois.nouaille/dev/osc-cli-curses/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/certifi/__init__.pyResponse.iter_linesParseBaseException.markInputline
    Converter to concatenate all matching tokens to a single string.
    By default, the matching patterns must also be contiguous in the input string;
    this can be disabled by specifying C{'adjacent=False'} in the constructor.

    Example::
        real = Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums)
        print(real.parseString('3.1416')) # -> ['3', '.', '1416']
        # will also erroneously match the following
        print(real.parseString('3. 1416')) # -> ['3', '.', '1416']

        real = Combine(Word(nums) + '.' + Word(nums))
        print(real.parseString('3.1416')) # -> ['3.1416']
        # no match when there are internal spaces
        print(real.parseString('3. 1416')) # -> Exception: Expected W:(0123...)
    %s__%sDistribution.__ne__Metadata provider for egg directories

    Usage::

        # Development eggs:

        egg_info = "/path/to/PackageName.egg-info"
        base_dir = os.path.dirname(egg_info)
        metadata = PathMetadata(base_dir, egg_info)
        dist_name = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(egg_info))[0]
        dist = Distribution(basedir, project_name=dist_name, metadata=metadata)

        # Unpacked egg directories:

        egg_path = "/path/to/PackageName-ver-pyver-etc.egg"
        metadata = PathMetadata(egg_path, os.path.join(egg_path,'EGG-INFO'))
        dist = Distribution.from_filename(egg_path, metadata=metadata)
    Dictionary lookup object.
    Helper to quickly define a set of alternative Literals, and makes sure to do
    longest-first testing when there is a conflict, regardless of the input order,
    but returns a C{L{MatchFirst}} for best performance.

    Parameters:
     - strs - a string of space-delimited literals, or a collection of string literals
     - caseless - (default=C{False}) - treat all literals as caseless
     - useRegex - (default=C{True}) - as an optimization, will generate a Regex
          object; otherwise, will generate a C{MatchFirst} object (if C{caseless=True}, or
          if creating a C{Regex} raises an exception)

    Example::
        comp_oper = oneOf("< = > <= >= !=")
        var = Word(alphas)
        number = Word(nums)
        term = var | number
        comparison_expr = term + comp_oper + term
        print(comparison_expr.searchString("B = 12  AA=23 B<=AA AA>12"))
    prints::
        [['B', '=', '12'], ['AA', '=', '23'], ['B', '<=', 'AA'], ['AA', '>', '12']]

 WrappedSocket.recv_into
    Helper to return the original, untokenized text for a given expression.  Useful to
    restore the parsed fields of an HTML start tag into the raw tag text itself, or to
    revert separate tokens with intervening whitespace back to the original matching
    input text. By default, returns astring containing the original parsed text.  
       
    If the optional C{asString} argument is passed as C{False}, then the return value is a 
    C{L{ParseResults}} containing any results names that were originally matched, and a 
    single token containing the original matched text from the input string.  So if 
    the expression passed to C{L{originalTextFor}} contains expressions with defined
    results names, you must set C{asString} to C{False} if you want to preserve those
    results name values.

    Example::
        src = "this is test <b> bold <i>text</i> </b> normal text "
        for tag in ("b","i"):
            opener,closer = makeHTMLTags(tag)
            patt = originalTextFor(opener + SkipTo(closer) + closer)
            print(patt.searchString(src)[0])
    prints::

    base exception class for all parsing runtime exceptionsOrderedDict.__repr__%s %s requires %s, which is not installed.Text literal
    Helper method for constructing grammars of expressions made up of
    operators working in a precedence hierarchy.  Operators may be unary or
    binary, left- or right-associative.  Parse actions can also be attached
    to operator expressions. The generated parser will also recognize the use 
    of parentheses to override operator precedences (see example below).
    
    Note: if you define a deep operator list, you may see performance issues
    when using infixNotation. See L{ParserElement.enablePackrat} for a
    mechanism to potentially improve your parser performance.

    Parameters:
     - baseExpr - expression representing the most basic element for the nested
     - opList - list of tuples, one for each operator precedence level in the
      expression grammar; each tuple is of the form
      (opExpr, numTerms, rightLeftAssoc, parseAction), where:
       - opExpr is the pyparsing expression for the operator;
          may also be a string, which will be converted to a Literal;
          if numTerms is 3, opExpr is a tuple of two expressions, for the
          two operators separating the 3 terms
       - numTerms is the number of terms for this operator (must
          be 1, 2, or 3)
       - rightLeftAssoc is the indicator whether the operator is
          right or left associative, using the pyparsing-defined
          constants C{opAssoc.RIGHT} and C{opAssoc.LEFT}.
       - parseAction is the parse action to be associated with
          expressions matching this operator expression (the
          parse action tuple member may be omitted); if the parse action
          is passed a tuple or list of functions, this is equivalent to
          calling C{setParseAction(*fn)} (L{ParserElement.setParseAction})
     - lpar - expression for matching left-parentheses (default=C{Suppress('(')})
     - rpar - expression for matching right-parentheses (default=C{Suppress(')')})

    Example::
        # simple example of four-function arithmetic with ints and variable names
        integer = pyparsing_common.signed_integer
        varname = pyparsing_common.identifier 
        
        arith_expr = infixNotation(integer | varname,
            [
            ('-', 1, opAssoc.RIGHT),
            (oneOf('* /'), 2, opAssoc.LEFT),
            (oneOf('+ -'), 2, opAssoc.LEFT),
            ])

        Disables the skipping of whitespace before matching the characters in the
        C{ParserElement}'s defined pattern.  This is normally only used internally by
        the pyparsing module, but may be needed in some whitespace-sensitive grammars.
        UTF8Prober.feedA case-insensitive ``dict``-like object.

    Implements all methods and operations of
    ``MutableMapping`` as well as dict's ``copy``. Also
    provides ``lower_items``.

    All keys are expected to be strings. The structure remembers the
    case of the last key to be set, and ``iter(instance)``,
    ``keys()``, ``items()``, ``iterkeys()``, and ``iteritems()``
    will contain case-sensitive keys. However, querying and contains
    testing is case insensitive::

        cid = CaseInsensitiveDict()
        cid['Accept'] = 'application/json'
        cid['aCCEPT'] == 'application/json'  # True
        list(cid) == ['Accept']  # True

    For example, ``headers['content-encoding']`` will return the
    value of a ``'Content-Encoding'`` response header, regardless
    of how the header name was originally stored.

    If the constructor, ``.update``, or equality comparison
    operations are given keys that have equal ``.lower()``s, the
    behavior is undefined.
    
    This enum represents the likelihood of a character following the previous one.

        this method will return immediately.

    Given a string and an iterable of delimiters, split on the first found
    delimiter. Return two split parts and the matched delimiter.

    If not found, then the first part is the full input string.

    Example::

        >>> split_first('foo/bar?baz', '?/=')
        ('foo', 'bar?baz', '/')
        >>> split_first('foo/bar?baz', '123')
        ('foo/bar?baz', '', None)

    Scales linearly with number of delims. Not ideal for large number of delims.

        After calling ``feed``, you can check the value of the ``done``
        attribute to see if you need to continue feeding the
        ``UniversalDetector`` more data, or if it has made a prediction
        (in the ``result`` attribute).

           You should always call ``close`` when you're done feeding in your
           document if ``done`` is not already ``True``.

Should accept one argument (the object to be represented), and return a string.FileMetadata.get_metadata_linesParseBaseException.__repr__
        Execute the parse expression with the given string.
        This is the main interface to the client code, once the complete
        expression has been built.

        If you want the grammar to require that the entire input string be
        successfully parsed, then set C{parseAll} to True (equivalent to ending
        the grammar with C{L{StringEnd()}}).

        Note: C{parseString} implicitly calls C{expandtabs()} on the input string,
        in order to report proper column numbers in parse actions.
        If the input string contains tabs and
        the grammar uses parse actions that use the C{loc} argument to index into the
        string being parsed, you can ensure you have a consistent view of the input
        string by:
         - calling C{parseWithTabs} on your grammar before calling C{parseString}
           (see L{I{parseWithTabs}<parseWithTabs>})
         - define your parse action using the full C{(s,loc,toks)} signature, and
           reference the input string using the parse action's C{s} argument
         - explictly expand the tabs in your input string before calling
           C{parseString}
        
        Example::
            Word('a').parseString('aaaaabaaa')  # -> ['aaaaa']
            Word('a').parseString('aaaaabaaa', parseAll=True)  # -> Exception: Expected end of text

    The ``UniversalDetector`` class underlies the ``chardet.detect`` function
    and coordinates all of the different charset probers.

    To get a ``dict`` containing an encoding and its confidence, you can simply
    run:

    .. code::

            u = UniversalDetector()
            u.feed(some_bytes)

SecureTranport support for urllib3 via ctypes.

This makes platform-native TLS available to urllib3 users on macOS without the
use of a compiler. This is an important feature because the Python Package
Index is moving to become a TLSv1.2-or-higher server, and the default OpenSSL
that ships with macOS is not capable of doing TLSv1.2. The only way to resolve
this is to give macOS users an alternative solution to the problem, and that
solution is to use SecureTransport.

We use ctypes here because this solution must not require a compiler. That's
because pip is not allowed to require a compiler either.

This is not intended to be a seriously long-term solution to this problem.
The hope is that PEP 543 will eventually solve this issue for us, at which
point we can retire this contrib module. But in the short term, we need to
solve the impending tire fire that is Python on Mac without this kind of
contrib module. So...here we are.

To use this module, simply import and inject it::

    import urllib3.contrib.securetransport
    urllib3.contrib.securetransport.inject_into_urllib3()

Happy TLSing!

        `requirements` must be a sequence of ``Requirement`` objects.  `env`,
        if supplied, should be an ``Environment`` instance.  If
        not supplied, it defaults to all distributions available within any
        entry or distribution in the working set.  `installer`, if supplied,
        will be invoked with each requirement that cannot be met by an
        already-installed distribution; it should return a ``Distribution`` or
        ``None``.

        Unless `replace_conflicting=True`, raises a VersionConflict exception
        if
        any requirements are found on the path that have the correct name but
        the wrong version.  Otherwise, if an `installer` is supplied it will be
        invoked to obtain the correct version of the requirement and activate
        it.

        `extras` is a list of the extras to be used with these requirements.
        This is important because extra requirements may look like `my_req;
        extra = "my_extra"`, which would otherwise be interpreted as a purely
        optional requirement.  Instead, we want to be able to assert that these
        requirements are truly required.

requests.hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module provides the capabilities for the Requests hooks system.

Available hooks:

``response``:
    The response generated from a Request.

    Given a single file, loads all the trust objects from it into arrays and
    the keychain.
    Returns a tuple of lists: the first list is a list of identities, the
    second a list of certs.
    Python HTTP for Humans.LookupDict.__getitem__
        Inserts new element at location index in the list of parsed tokens.
        
        Similar to C{list.insert()}.

        Example::
            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> ['0', '123', '321']

            # use a parse action to insert the parse location in the front of the parsed results
            def insert_locn(locn, tokens):
                tokens.insert(0, locn)
            print(OneOrMore(Word(nums)).addParseAction(insert_locn).parseString("0 123 321")) # -> [0, '0', '123', '321']
        
    Requires all given C{ParseExpression}s to be found, but in any order.
    Expressions may be separated by whitespace.
    May be constructed using the C{'&'} operator.

    Example::
        color = oneOf("RED ORANGE YELLOW GREEN BLUE PURPLE BLACK WHITE BROWN")
        shape_type = oneOf("SQUARE CIRCLE TRIANGLE STAR HEXAGON OCTAGON")
        integer = Word(nums)
        shape_attr = "shape:" + shape_type("shape")
        posn_attr = "posn:" + Group(integer("x") + ',' + integer("y"))("posn")
        color_attr = "color:" + color("color")
        size_attr = "size:" + integer("size")

        # use Each (using operator '&') to accept attributes in any order 
        # (shape and posn are required, color and size are optional)
        shape_spec = shape_attr & posn_attr & Optional(color_attr) & Optional(size_attr)

    Token to exactly match a specified string as a keyword, that is, it must be
    immediately followed by a non-keyword character.  Compare with C{L{Literal}}:
     - C{Literal("if")} will match the leading C{'if'} in C{'ifAndOnlyIf'}.
     - C{Keyword("if")} will not; it will only match the leading C{'if'} in C{'if x=1'}, or C{'if(y==2)'}
    Accepts two optional constructor arguments in addition to the keyword string:
     - C{identChars} is a string of characters that would be valid identifier characters,
          defaulting to all alphanumerics + "_" and "$"
     - C{caseless} allows case-insensitive matching, default is C{False}.
       
    Example::
        Keyword("start").parseString("start")  # -> ['start']
        Keyword("start").parseString("starting")  # -> Exception

    For case-insensitive matching, use L{CaselessKeyword}.

Package resource API
--------------------

A resource is a logical file contained within a package, or a logical
subdirectory thereof.  The package resource API expects resource names
to have their path parts separated with ``/``, *not* whatever the local
path separator is.  Do not use os.path operations to manipulate resource
names being passed into the API.

The package resource API is designed to work with normal filesystem packages,
.egg files, and unpacked .egg files.  It can also work in a limited way with
.zip files and with custom PEP 302 loaders that support the ``get_data()``
method.

    distutils.util.get_platform() normally reports the minimum version
    of Mac OS X that would be required to *use* extensions produced by
    distutils.  But what we want when checking compatibility is to know the
    version of Mac OS X that we are *running*.  To allow usage of packages that
    explicitly require a newer version of Mac OS X, we must also know the
    current version of the OS.

    If this condition occurs for any other platform with a version in its
    platform strings, this function should be extended accordingly.

        `requirements` must be a sequence of ``Requirement`` objects.  `env`,
        if supplied, should be an ``Environment`` instance.  If
        not supplied, it defaults to all distributions available within any
        entry or distribution in the working set.  `installer`, if supplied,
        will be invoked with each requirement that cannot be met by an
        already-installed distribution; it should return a ``Distribution`` or
        ``None``.

        Unless `replace_conflicting=True`, raises a VersionConflict exception
        if
        any requirements are found on the path that have the correct name but
        the wrong version.  Otherwise, if an `installer` is supplied it will be
        invoked to obtain the correct version of the requirement and activate
        it.

        `extras` is a list of the extras to be used with these requirements.
        This is important because extra requirements may look like `my_req;
        extra = "my_extra"`, which would otherwise be interpreted as a purely
        optional requirement.  Instead, we want to be able to assert that these
        requirements are truly required.

        Example usage::

            distributions, errors = working_set.find_plugins(
                Environment(plugin_dirlist)
            )
            # add plugins+libs to sys.path
            map(working_set.add, distributions)
            # display errors
            print('Could not load', errors)

        The `plugin_env` should be an ``Environment`` instance that contains
        only distributions that are in the project's "plugin directory" or
        directories. The `full_env`, if supplied, should be an ``Environment``
        contains all currently-available distributions.  If `full_env` is not
        supplied, one is created automatically from the ``WorkingSet`` this
        method is called on, which will typically mean that every directory on
        ``sys.path`` will be scanned for distributions.

        `installer` is a standard installer callback as used by the
        ``resolve()`` method. The `fallback` flag indicates whether we should
        attempt to resolve older versions of a plugin if the newest version
        cannot be resolved.

        This method returns a 2-tuple: (`distributions`, `error_info`), where
        `distributions` is a list of the distributions found in `plugin_env`
        that were loadable, along with any other distributions that are needed
        to resolve their dependencies.  `error_info` is a dictionary mapping
        unloadable plugin distributions to an exception instance describing the
        error that occurred. Usually this will be a ``DistributionNotFound`` or
        ``VersionConflict`` instance.

        Any distributions found on `search_path` are added to the environment.
        `search_path` should be a sequence of ``sys.path`` items.  If not
        supplied, ``sys.path`` is used.

        `platform` is an optional string specifying the name of the platform
        that platform-specific distributions must be compatible with.  If
        unspecified, it defaults to the current platform.  `python` is an
        optional string naming the desired version of Python (e.g. ``'3.6'``);
        it defaults to the current version.

        You may explicitly set `platform` (and/or `python`) to ``None`` if you
        wish to map *all* distributions, not just those compatible with the
        running platform or Python version.

        platform-specific fallbacks.  See that routine's documentation for more
        details.)

        Resources are extracted to subdirectories of this path based upon
        information given by the ``IResourceProvider``.  You may set this to a
        temporary directory, but then you must call ``cleanup_resources()`` to
        delete the extracted files when done.  There is no guarantee that
        ``cleanup_resources()`` will be able to remove all extracted files.

    `importer_type` is the type or class of a PEP 302 "Importer" (sys.path item
    handler), and `namespace_handler` is a callable like this::

        def namespace_handler(importer, path_entry, moduleName, module):
            # return a path_entry to use for child packages

    Namespace handlers are only called if the importer object has already
    agreed that it can handle the relevant path item, and they should only
    return a subpath if the module __path__ does not already contain an
    equivalent subpath.  For an example namespace handler, see
    ``pkg_resources.file_ns_handler``.

    Contrary to POSIX 2008, on Cygwin, getcwd (3) contains
    symlink components. Using
    os.path.abspath() works around this limitation. A fix in os.getcwd()
    would probably better, in Cygwin even more so, except
    that this seems to be by design...

        Packages installed by distutils (e.g. numpy or scipy),
        which uses an old safe_version, and so
        their version numbers can get mangled when
        converted to filenames (e.g., 1.11.0.dev0+2329eae to
        1.11.0.dev0_2329eae). These distributions will not be
        parsed properly
        downstream by Distribution and safe_version, so
        take an extra step and try to get the version number from
        the metadata file itself instead of the filename.

        'where' is the root directory which will be searched for packages.  It
        should be supplied as a "cross-platform" (i.e. URL-style) path; it will
        be converted to the appropriate local path syntax.

        'exclude' is a sequence of package names to exclude; '*' can be used
        as a wildcard in the names, such that 'foo.*' will exclude all
        subpackages of 'foo' (but not 'foo' itself).

        'include' is a sequence of package names to include.  If it's
        specified, only the named packages will be included.  If it's not
        specified, all found packages will be included.  'include' can contain
        shell style wildcard patterns just like 'exclude'.
